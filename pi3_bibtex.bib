  abstract = {The success of using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for speech recognition application has motivated the adoption of these models for handwriting recognition especially the online handwriting that has large similarity with the speech signal as a sequential process. Some languages such as Arabic, Farsi and Urdo include large number of delayed strokes that are written above or below most letters and usually written delayed in time. These delayed strokes represent a modeling challenge for the conventional left-right HMM that is commonly used for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for handling delayed strokes in Arabic online handwriting recognition using HMMs. We also show that several modeling approaches such as context based tri-grapheme models, speaker adaptive training and discriminative training that are currently used in most state-of-the-art ASR systems can provide similar performance improvement for Hand Writing Recognition (HWR) systems. Finally, we show that using a multi-pass decoder that use the computationally less expensive models in the early passes can provide an Arabic large vocabulary HWR system with practical decoding time. We evaluated the performance of our proposed Arabic HWR system using two databases of small and large lexicons. For the small lexicon data set, our system achieved competing results compared to the best reported state-of-the-art Arabic HWR systems. For the large lexicon, our system achieved promising results (accuracy and time) for a vocabulary size of 64k words with the possibility of adapting the models for specific writers to get even better results.},

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is critical but often struggles with accuracy and efficiency in complex layouts and ambiguous text. These challenges are especially pronounced in large-scale tasks requiring both speed and precision. This paper introduces LMV-RPA, a Large Model Voting-based Robotic Process Automation system to enhance OCR workflows. LMV-RPA integrates outputs from OCR engines such as Paddle OCR, Tesseract OCR, Easy OCR, and DocTR with Large Language Models (LLMs) like LLaMA 3 and Gemini-1.5-pro. Using a majority voting mechanism, it processes OCR outputs into structured JSON formats, improving accuracy, particularly in complex layouts. The multi-phase pipeline processes text extracted by OCR engines through LLMs, combining results to ensure the most accurate outputs. LMV-RPA achieves 99 percent accuracy in OCR tasks, surpassing baseline models with 94 percent, while reducing processing time by 80 percent. Benchmark evaluations confirm its scalability and demonstrate that LMV-RPA offers a faster, more reliable, and efficient solution for automating large-scale document processing tasks.},

Existing approaches, such as the DeepDoc-Classifier, apply standard Convolutional Network architectures with transfer learning from the object recognition domain. The contribution of the paper is threefold: First, it investigates recently introduced very deep neural network architectures (GoogLeNet, VGG, ResNet) using transfer learning (from real images). Second, it proposes transfer learning from a huge set of document images, i.e. 400; 000 documents. Third, it analyzes the impact of the amount of training data (document images) and other parameters to the classification abilities. We use two datasets, the Tobacco-3482 and the large-scale RVL-CDIP dataset. We achieve an accuracy of 91:13\% for the Tobacco-3482 dataset while earlier approaches reach only 77:6\%. Thus, a relative error reduction of more than 60\% is achieved. For the large dataset RVL-CDIP, an accuracy of 90:97\% is achieved, corresponding to a relative error reduction of 11:5\%.},

Our model can synthesize arbitrary text, while giving users control over the visual appearance (style). For example, allowing for style transfer without changing the content, editing of digital ink at the word level and other application scenarios such as spell-checking and correction of handwritten text. We furthermore contribute a new dataset of handwritten text with fine-grained annotations at the character level and report results from an initial user evaluation.},

As a result, a great deal of emphasis is now being placed on its practical deployment and integration into modern industrial document processing pipelines. It is well known, however, that deep learning models are data-hungry and often require huge volumes of annotated data in order to achieve competitive performances. And since data annotation is a costly and labor-intensive process, it remains one of the major hurdles to their practical deployment. This study investigates the possibility of using active learning to reduce the costs of data annotation in the context of document image classification, which is one of the core components of modern document processing pipelines. The results of this study demonstrate that by utilizing active learning (AL), deep document classification models can achieve competitive performances to the models trained on fully annotated datasets and, in some cases, even surpass them by annotating only 15--40\% of the total training dataset. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that modern AL strategies significantly outperform random querying, and in many cases achieve comparable performance to the models trained on fully annotated datasets even in the presence of practical deployment issues such as data imbalance, and annotation noise, and thus, offer tremendous benefits in real-world deployment of deep document classification models.

In this study, we introduce a hybrid form archive written in French: the Belfort civil registers of births. The digitization of these historical documents is challenging due to their unique characteristics such as writing style variations, overlapped characters and words, and marginal annotations. The objective of this survey paper is to summarize research on handwritten text documents and provide research directions toward effectively transcribing this French dataset. To achieve this goal, we presented a brief survey of several modern and historical HTR offline systems of different international languages, and the top state-of-the-art contributions reported of the French language specifically. The survey classifies the HTR systems based on techniques employed, datasets used, publication years, and the level of recognition. Furthermore, an analysis of the systems' accuracies is presented, highlighting the best-performing approach. We have also showcased the performance of some HTR commercial systems. In addition, this paper presents a summarization of the HTR datasets that publicly available, especially those identified as benchmark datasets in the International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR) and the International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition (ICFHR) competitions. This paper, therefore, presents updated state-of-the-art research in HTR and highlights new directions in the research field.},

In order to partially satisfy this requirement, we propose a system based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to produce synthetic images of handwritten words. We use bidirectional LSTM recurrent layers to get an embedding of the word to be rendered, and we feed it to the generator network. We also modify the standard GAN by adding an auxiliary network for text recognition. The system is then trained with a balanced combination of an adversarial loss and a CTC loss. Together, these extensions to GAN enable to control the textual content of the generated word images. We obtain realistic images on both French and Arabic datasets, and we show that integrating these synthetic images into the existing training data of a text recognition system can slightly enhance its performance.},

To explore the effectivity of new strategies for OCR post-correction, this article focuses on methods of character-based machine translation, specifically neural machine translation and statistical machine translation. Using the ICDAR 2017 data set on OCR post-correction for English and French, we experiment with different strategies for error detection and error correction. We analyze how OCR post-correction with NMT can profit from using additional information and show that SMT and NMT can benefit from each other for these tasks. An ensemble of our models reached best performance in ICDAR's 2017 error correction subtask and performed competitively in error detection. However, our experimental results also suggest that tuning supervised learning for OCR post-correction of texts from different sources, text types (periodicals and monographs), time periods and languages is a difficult task: the data on which the MT systems are trained have a large influence on which methods and features work best. Conclusive and generally applicable insights are hard to achieve.},

  abstract = {For many applications, in particular in natural science, the task is to determine hidden system parameters from a set of measurements. Often, the forward process from parameter- to measurement-space is well-defined, whereas the inverse problem is ambiguous: multiple parameter sets can result in the same measurement. To fully characterize this ambiguity, the full posterior parameter distribution, conditioned on an observed measurement, has to be determined. We argue that a particular class of neural networks is well suited for this task - so-called Invertible Neural Networks (INNs). Unlike classical neural networks, which attempt to solve the ambiguous inverse problem directly, INNs focus on learning the forward process, using additional latent output variables to capture the information otherwise lost. Due to invertibility, a model of the corresponding inverse process is learned implicitly. Given a specific measurement and the distribution of the latent variables, the inverse pass of the INN provides the full posterior over parameter space. We prove theoretically and verify experimentally, on artificial data and real-world problems from medicine and astrophysics, that INNs are a powerful analysis tool to find multi-modalities in parameter space, uncover parameter correlations, and identify unrecoverable parameters.},

It is a key step in document parsing for their understanding. In this paper, we present a unified transformer encoder-decoder architecture for en-to-end instance segmentation of complex layouts in document images. The method adapts a contrastive training with a mixed query selection for anchor initialization in the decoder. Later on, it performs a dot product between the obtained query embeddings and the pixel embedding map (coming from the encoder) for semantic reasoning.

  abstract = {We introduce a self-supervised vision representation model BEiT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder representation from Image Transformers. Following BERT developed in the natural language processing area, we propose a masked image modeling task to pretrain vision Transformers. Specifically, each image has two views in our pre-training, i.e, image patches (such as 16x16 pixels), and visual tokens (i.e., discrete tokens). We first "tokenize" the original image into visual tokens. Then we randomly mask some image patches and fed them into the backbone Transformer. The pre-training objective is to recover the original visual tokens based on the corrupted image patches. After pre-training BEiT, we directly fine-tune the model parameters on downstream tasks by appending task layers upon the pretrained encoder. Experimental results on image classification and semantic segmentation show that our model achieves competitive results with previous pre-training methods. For example, base-size BEiT achieves 83.2\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, significantly outperforming from-scratch DeiT training (81.8\%) with the same setup. Moreover, large-size BEiT obtains 86.3\% only using ImageNet-1K, even outperforming ViT-L with supervised pre-training on ImageNet-22K (85.2\%).

  abstract = {We present a generalization of the Cauchy/Lorentzian, Geman-McClure, Welsch/Leclerc, generalized Charbon-nier, Charbonnier/pseudo-Huber/L1-L2, and L2 loss functions. By introducing robustness as a continuous parameter , our loss function allows algorithms built around robust loss minimization to be generalized, which improves performance on basic vision tasks such as registration and clustering. Interpreting our loss as the negative log of a univariate density yields a general probability distribution that includes normal and Cauchy distributions as special cases. This probabilistic interpretation enables the training of neural networks in which the robustness of the loss automatically adapts itself during training, which improves performance on learning-based tasks such as generative image synthesis and unsupervised monocular depth estimation , without requiring any manual parameter tuning. Many problems in statistics and optimization require ro-bustness-that a model be less influenced by outliers than by inliers [17, 19]. This idea is common in parameter estimation and learning tasks, where a robust loss (say, absolute error) may be preferred over a non-robust loss (say, squared error) due to its reduced sensitivity to large errors. Researchers have developed various robust penalties with particular properties, many of which are summarized well in [3, 39]. In gradient descent or M-estimation [16] these losses are often interchangeable, so researchers may experiment with different losses when designing a system. This flexibility in shaping a loss function may be useful because of non-Gaussian noise, or simply because the loss that is minimized during learning or parameter estimation is different from how the resulting learned model or estimated parameters will be evaluated. For example, one might train a neural network by minimizing the difference between the network's output and a set of images, but evaluate that network in terms of how well it hallucinates random images. In this paper we present a single loss function that is a superset of many common robust loss functions. A single continuous-valued parameter in our general loss function can be set such that it is equal to several traditional losses, and can be adjusted to model a wider family of functions. This allows us to generalize algorithms built around a fixed robust loss with a new "robustness" hyperparameter that can be tuned or annealed to improve performance. Though new hyperparameters may be valuable to a practitioner , they complicate experimentation by requiring manual tuning or time-consuming cross-validation. However, by viewing our general loss function as the negative log-likelihood of a probability distribution, and by treating the robustness of that distribution as a latent variable, we show that maximizing the likelihood of that distribution allows gradient-based optimization frameworks to automatically determine how robust the loss should be without any manual parameter tuning. This "adaptive" form of our loss is particularly effective in models with multivariate output spaces (say, image generation or depth estimation) as we can introduce independent robustness variables for each dimension in the output and thereby allow the model to independently adapt the robustness of its loss in each dimension. The rest of the paper is as follows: In Section 1 we define our general loss function, relate it to existing losses, and enumerate some of its useful properties. In Section 2 we use our loss to construct a probability distribution , which requires deriving a partition function and a sampling procedure. Section 3 discusses four representative experiments: In Sections 3.1 and 3.2 we take two Figure 1. Our general loss function (left) and its gradient (right) for different values of its shape parameter {$\alpha$}. Several values of {$\alpha$} reproduce existing loss functions: L2 loss ({$\alpha$} = 2), Charbonnier loss ({$\alpha$} = 1), Cauchy loss ({$\alpha$} = 0), Geman-McClure loss ({$\alpha$} = -2), and Welsch loss ({$\alpha$} = -{$\infty$}).},

  abstract = {The backpropagation of error algorithm (BP) is impossible to implement in a real brain. The recent success of deep networks in machine learning and AI, however, has inspired proposals for understanding how the brain might learn across multiple layers, and hence how it might approximate BP. As of yet, none of these proposals have been rigorously evaluated on tasks where BP-guided deep learning has proved critical, or in architectures more structured than simple fully-connected networks. Here we present results on scaling up biologically motivated models of deep learning on datasets which need deep networks with appropriate architectures to achieve good performance. We present results on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet datasets, explore variants of target-propagation (TP) and feedback alignment (FA) algorithms, and examine performance in both fully-and locally-connected architectures. We also introduce weight-transport-free variants of difference target propagation (DTP) modified to remove backpropagation from the penultimate layer. Many of these algorithms perform well for MNIST, but for CIFAR and ImageNet we find that TP and FA variants perform significantly worse than BP, especially for networks composed of locally connected units, opening questions about whether new architectures and algorithms are required to scale these approaches. Our results and implementation details help establish baselines for biologically motivated deep learning schemes going forward.},

The problem is that labeling samples is a time-consuming task because it requires human expertise and thus, cannot be automated well. In this work, we propose a novel method to construct synthetic labeled datasets for historical documents where no annotations are available. We train a StyleGAN model to synthesize document images that capture the core features of the original documents. While originally, the StyleGAN architecture was not intended to produce labels, it indirectly learns the underlying semantics to generate realistic images. Using our approach, we can extract the semantic information from the intermediate feature maps and use it to generate ground truth labels. To investigate if our synthetic dataset can be used to segment the text in historical documents, we use it to train multiple supervised segmentation models and evaluate their performance. We also train these models on another dataset created by a state-of-the-art synthesis approach to show that the models trained on our dataset achieve better results while requiring even less human annotation effort.},

  abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proved exceptional at learning representations for visual object categorization. However, CNNs do not explicitly encode objects, parts, and their physical properties, which has limited CNNs' success on tasks that require structured understanding of visual scenes. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the idea of Physical Scene Graphs (PSGs), which represent scenes as hierarchical graphs, with nodes in the hierarchy corresponding intuitively to object parts at different scales, and edges to physical connections between parts. Bound to each node is a vector of latent attributes that intuitively represent object properties such as surface shape and texture. We also describe PSGNet, a network architecture that learns to extract PSGs by reconstructing scenes through a PSG-structured bottleneck. PSGNet augments standard CNNs by including: recurrent feedback connections to combine low and high-level image information; graph pooling and vectorization operations that convert spatially-uniform feature maps into object-centric graph structures; and perceptual grouping principles to encourage the identification of meaningful scene elements. We show that PSGNet outperforms alternative self-supervised scene representation algorithms at scene segmentation tasks, especially on complex real-world images, and generalizes well to unseen object types and scene arrangements. PSGNet is also able learn from physical motion, enhancing scene estimates even for static images. We present a series of ablation studies illustrating the importance of each component of the PSGNet architecture, analyses showing that learned latent attributes capture intuitive scene properties, and illustrate the use of PSGs for compositional scene inference.},

The paper re-visits the binarization problem by introducing an adversarial learning approach. We construct a Texture Augmentation Network that transfers the texture element of a degraded reference document image to a clean binary image. In this way, the network creates multiple versions of the same textual content with various noisy textures, thus enlarging the available document binarization datasets. At last, the newly generated images are passed through a Binarization network to get back the clean version. By jointly training the two networks we can increase the adversarial robustness of our system. Also, it is noteworthy that our model can learn from unpaired data.

We take handwritten data in either modality as input and the opposite modality is generated through intermodality conversion. Thereafter, we feed this offline-online modality pair to our network. Hence, along with the advantage of utilizing information from both the modalities, the proposed framework can work for both offline and online script identification which alleviates the need for designing two separate script identification modules for individual modality. We also propose a novel conditional multi-modal fusion scheme to combine the information from offline and online modality which takes into account the original modality of the data being fed to our network and thus it combines adaptively. An exhaustive experimental study has been done on a data set including English(Roman) and 6 other official Indic scripts.

  abstract = {In real life, various degradation scenarios exist that might damage document images, making it harder to recognize and analyze them, thus binarization is a fundamental and crucial step for achieving the most optimal performance in any document analysis task. We propose DocBinFormer (Document Binarization Transformer), a novel two-level vision transformer (TL-ViT) architecture based on vision transformers for effective document image binarization. The presented architecture employs a two-level transformer encoder to effectively capture both global and local feature representation from the input images. These complimentary bi-level features are exploited for efficient document image binarization, resulting in improved results for system-generated as well as handwritten document images in a comprehensive approach. With the absence of convolutional layers, the transformer encoder uses the pixel patches and sub-patches along with their positional information to operate directly on them, while the decoder generates a clean (binarized) output image from the latent representation of the patches. Instead of using a simple vision transformer block to extract information from the image patches, the proposed architecture uses two transformer blocks for greater coverage of the extracted feature space on a global and local scale. The encoded feature representation is used by the decoder block to generate the corresponding binarized output. Extensive experiments on a variety of DIBCO and H-DIBCO benchmarks show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on four metrics.

In the common case that one matrix is known ahead of time, our method also has the interesting property that it requires zero multiply-adds.

In this paper, we propose a new neural network architecture for state-of-The-art handwriting recognition, alternative to multi-dimensional long short-Term memory (MD-LSTM) recurrent neural networks. The model is based on a convolutional encoder of the input images, and a bidirectional LSTM decoder predicting character sequences. In this paradigm, we aim at producing generic, multilingual and reusable features with the convolutional encoder, leveraging more data for transfer learning. The architecture is also motivated by the need for a fast training on GPUs, and the requirement of a fast decoding on CPUs. The main contribution of this paper lies in the convolutional gates in the encoder, enabling hierarchical context-sensitive feature extraction. The experiments on a large benchmark including seven languages show a consistent and significant improvement of the proposed approach over our previous production systems. We also report state-of-The-art results on line and paragraph level recognition on the IAM and Rimes databases.},

Still, since the visual capabilities have been added to these models recently, there has not been much progress on the uncertainty of Visual Language Models (VLMs). We tested three state-of-the-art VLMs on corrupted image data.

In particular, these models employ a variety of subword tokenization methods, most notably byte-pair encoding (BPE) (Sennrich et al., 2016; Gage, 1994), the WordPiece method (Schuster and Nakajima, 2012), and unigram language modeling (Kudo, 2018), to segment text. However, to the best of our knowledge, the literature does not contain a direct evaluation of the impact of tokenization on language model pretraining. We analyze differences between BPE and unigram LM tokenization, finding that the latter method recovers subword units that align more closely with morphology and avoids problems stemming from BPE`s greedy construction procedure. We then compare the fine-tuned task performance of identical transformer masked language models pretrained with these tokenizations. Across downstream tasks and two languages (English and Japanese), we find that the unigram LM tokenization method matches or outperforms BPE. We hope that developers of future pretrained LMs will consider adopting the unigram LM method over the more prevalent BPE.},

  abstract = {(ABSTRACT) With the proliferation of computers into homes and businesses and the explosive growth rate of the Internet, the ability to conduct secure electronic communications and transactions has become an issue of vital concern. One of the most prominent systems for securing electronic information, known as RSA, relies upon the fact that it is computationally difficult to factor a "large" integer into its component prime integers. If an efficient algorithm is developed that can factor any arbitrarily large integer in a "reasonable" amount of time, the security value of the RSA system would be nullified. The General Number Field Sieve algorithm is the fastest known method for factoring large integers. Research and development of this algorithm within the past five years has facilitated factorizations of integers that were once speculated to require thousands of years of supercomputer time to accomplish. While this method has many unexplored features that merit further research, the complexity of the algorithm prevents almost anyone but an expert from investigating its behavior. We address this concern by first pulling together much of the background information necessary to understand the concepts that are central in the General Number Field Sieve. These concepts are woven together into a cohesive presentation that details each theory while clearly describing how a particular theory fits into the algorithm. Formal proofs from existing literature are recast and illuminated to clarify their inner-workings and the role they play in the whole process. We also present a complete, detailed example of a factorization achieved with the General Number Field Sieve in order to concretize the concepts that are outlined.},

  abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.},

  abstract = {Data augmentation is a commonly used technique for increasing both the size and the diversity of labeled training sets by leveraging input transformations that preserve corresponding output labels. In computer vision, image augmentations have become a common implicit regularization technique to combat overfitting in deep learning models and are ubiquitously used to improve performance. While most deep learning frameworks implement basic image transformations, the list is typically limited to some variations of flipping, rotating, scaling, and cropping. Moreover, image processing speed varies in existing image augmentation libraries. We present Albumentations, a fast and flexible open source library for image augmentation with many various image transform operations available that is also an easy-to-use wrapper around other augmentation libraries. We discuss the design principles that drove the implementation of Albumentations and give an overview of the key features and distinct capabilities. Finally, we provide examples of image augmentations for different computer vision tasks and demonstrate that Albumentations is faster than other commonly used image augmentation tools on most image transform operations.},

  abstract = {Unsupervised image representations have significantly reduced the gap with supervised pretraining, notably with the recent achievements of contrastive learning methods. These contrastive methods typically work online and rely on a large number of explicit pairwise feature comparisons, which is computationally challenging. In this paper, we propose an online algorithm, SwAV, that takes advantage of contrastive methods without requiring to compute pairwise comparisons. Specifically, our method simultaneously clusters the data while enforcing consistency between cluster assignments produced for different augmentations (or views) of the same image, instead of comparing features directly as in contrastive learning. Simply put, we use a swapped prediction mechanism where we predict the cluster assignment of a view from the representation of another view. Our method can be trained with large and small batches and can scale to unlimited amounts of data. Compared to previous contrastive methods, our method is more memory efficient since it does not require a large memory bank or a special momentum network. In addition, we also propose a new data augmentation strategy, multi-crop, that uses a mix of views with different resolutions in place of two full-resolution views, without increasing the memory or compute requirements much. We validate our findings by achieving 75.3\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with ResNet-50, as well as surpassing supervised pretraining on all the considered transfer tasks.},

In this paper, we show that some degree of locality can be introduced back into these models, greatly improving their efficiency while preserving their generality. To scale them further, we introduce a self-supervised approach that enables learning dense low-dimensional positional embeddings for very large signals. We call the resulting model a Hierarchical Perceiver (HiP). HiP retains the ability to process arbitrary modalities, but now at higher-resolution and without any specialized preprocessing, improving over flat Perceivers in both efficiency and accuracy on the ImageNet, Audioset and PASCAL VOC datasets.},

Various machine learning techniques have been used to recognize Chinese characters, but few works have studied the handwritten Chinese character generation problem, especially with unpaired training data. In this work, we formulate the Chinese handwritten character generation as a problem that learns a mapping from an existing printed font to a personalized handwritten style. We further propose DenseNet CycleGAN to generate Chinese handwritten characters. Our method is applied not only to commonly used Chinese characters but also to calligraphy work with aesthetic values. Furthermore, we propose content accuracy and style discrepancy as the evaluation metrics to assess the quality of the handwritten characters generated. We then use our proposed metrics to evaluate the generated characters from CASIA dataset as well as our newly introduced Lanting calligraphy dataset.},

This paper, alternatively, proposes a robot calligraphy system that firstly applies human arm gestures to establish a font database of Chinese character elementary strokes and English letters, then uses the created database and human gestures to write Chinese characters and English words. A three-dimensional motion sensing input device is deployed to capture the human arm trajectories, which are used to build the font database and to train a classifier ensemble. 26 types of human gesture are used for writing English letters, and 5 types of gesture are used to generate 5 elementary strokes for writing Chinese characters. By using the font database, the robot calligraphy system acquires a basic writing ability to write simple strokes and letters. Then, the robot can develop to write complex Chinese characters and English words by following human body movements. The classifier ensemble, which is used to identify each gesture, is implemented through using feature selection techniques and the harmony search algorithm, thereby achieving better classification performance. The experimental evaluations are carried out to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed method. By following the motion trajectories of the human right arm, the end-effector of the robot can successfully write the English words or Chinese characters that correspond to the arm trajectories.},

Our approach is based mainly on the intuition that if a neural net knows about where and what the objects are, we just need to teach it how to read them out. Beyond the use of task-specific data augmentations, our approach makes minimal assumptions about the task, yet it achieves competitive results on the challenging COCO dataset, compared to highly specialized and well optimized detection algorithms.},

To solve the first problem, we model the depth-induced saliency detection as a CNN-based cross-modal transfer learning problem. Instead of directly adopting the RGB CNN as initialization, we additionally train a modality classification network (MCNet) to encourage discriminative modality-specific representations in minimizing the modality classification loss. To solve the second problem, we propose a densely cross-level feedback topology, in which the cross-modal complements are combined in each level and then densely fed back to all shallower layers for sufficient cross-level interactions. Compared to traditional two-stream frameworks, the proposed one can better explore, select, and fuse cross-modal cross-level complements. Experiments show the significant and consistent improvements of the proposed CNN framework over other state-of-the-art methods.},

We simplify recently proposed contrastive self-supervised learning algorithms without requiring specialized architectures or a memory bank. In order to understand what enables the contrastive prediction tasks to learn useful representations, we systematically study the major components of our framework. We show that (1) composition of data augmentations plays a critical role in defining effective predictive tasks, (2) introducing a learnable nonlinear transformation between the representation and the contrastive loss substantially improves the quality of the learned representations, and (3) contrastive learning benefits from larger batch sizes and more training steps compared to supervised learning. By combining these findings, we are able to considerably outperform previous methods for self-supervised and semi-supervised learning on ImageNet. A linear classifier trained on self-supervised representations learned by SimCLR achieves 76.5\% top-1 accuracy, which is a 7\% relative improvement over previous state-of-the-art, matching the performance of a supervised ResNet-50. When fine-tuned on only 1\% of the labels, we achieve 85.8\% top-5 accuracy, outperforming AlexNet with 100X fewer labels.},

The first and sixth columns show input images while the remaining columns are images generated by StarGAN. Note that the images are generated by a single generator network, and facial expression labels such as angry, happy, and fearful are from RaFD, not CelebA. Abstract Recent studies have shown remarkable success in image-to-image translation for two domains. However, existing approaches have limited scalability and robustness in handling more than two domains, since different models should be built independently for every pair of image domains. To address this limitation, we propose StarGAN, a novel and scalable approach that can perform image-to-image translations for multiple domains using only a single model. Such a unified model architecture of StarGAN allows simultaneous training of multiple datasets with different domains within a single network. This leads to StarGAN's superior quality of translated images compared to existing models as well as the novel capability of flexibly translating an input image to any desired target domain. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a facial attribute transfer and a facial expression synthesis tasks.},

  abstract = {To make deliberate progress towards more intelligent and more human-like artificial systems, we need to be following an appropriate feedback signal: we need to be able to define and evaluate intelligence in a way that enables comparisons between two systems, as well as comparisons with humans. Over the past hundred years, there has been an abundance of attempts to define and measure intelligence, across both the fields of psychology and AI. We summarize and critically assess these definitions and evaluation approaches, while making apparent the two historical conceptions of intelligence that have implicitly guided them. We note that in practice, the contemporary AI community still gravitates towards benchmarking intelligence by comparing the skill exhibited by AIs and humans at specific tasks such as board games and video games. We argue that solely measuring skill at any given task falls short of measuring intelligence, because skill is heavily modulated by prior knowledge and experience: unlimited priors or unlimited training data allow experimenters to "buy" arbitrary levels of skills for a system, in a way that masks the system's own generalization power. We then articulate a new formal definition of intelligence based on Algorithmic Information Theory, describing intelligence as skill-acquisition efficiency and highlighting the concepts of scope, generalization difficulty, priors, and experience. Using this definition, we propose a set of guidelines for what a general AI benchmark should look like. Finally, we present a benchmark closely following these guidelines, the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), built upon an explicit set of priors designed to be as close as possible to innate human priors. We argue that ARC can be used to measure a human-like form of general fluid intelligence and that it enables fair general intelligence comparisons between AI systems and humans.},

Besides, CPE can keep the desired translation-invariance in the image classification task, resulting in improved performance. We implement CPE with a simple Position Encoding Generator (PEG) to get seamlessly incorporated into the current Transformer framework.

Contributing to its widespread adoption are the understandable and intuitive nature of the task, the relatively small size and storage requirements and the accessibility and ease-of-use of the database itself. The MNIST database was derived from a larger dataset known as the NIST Special Database 19 which contains digits, uppercase and lowercase handwritten letters. This paper introduces a variant of the full NIST dataset, which we have called Extended MNIST (EMNIST), which follows the same conversion paradigm used to create the MNIST dataset. The result is a dataset that constitutes a more challenging classification task involving letters and digits, and one that shares the same image structure and parameters as the original MNIST task, allowing for direct compatibility with all existing classifiers and systems. Benchmark results using an online ELM algorithm are presented along with a validation of the conversion process through the comparison of the classification results on NIST digits and the MNIST digits.},

Paragraph text recognition is traditionally achieved by two models: the first one for line segmentation and the second one for text line recognition. We propose a unified end-to-end model using hybrid attention to tackle this task. This model is designed to iteratively process a paragraph image line by line. It can be split into three modules. An encoder generates feature maps from the whole paragraph image. Then, an attention module recurrently generates a vertical weighted mask enabling to focus on the current text line features. This way, it performs a kind of implicit line segmentation. For each text line features, a decoder module recognizes the character sequence associated, leading to the recognition of a whole paragraph. We achieve state-of-the-art character error rate at paragraph level on three popular datasets: 1.91\% for RIMES, 4.45\% for IAM and 3.59\% for READ 2016.

The study benchmarks various proprietary and open-source LLMs against Transkribus models, evaluating their performance on both modern and historical datasets written in English, French, German, and Italian. In addition, emphasis is placed on testing the models' ability to autonomously correct previously generated outputs. Findings indicate that proprietary models, especially Claude 3.5 Sonnet, outperform open-source alternatives in zero-shot settings. MLLMs achieve excellent results in recognizing modern handwriting and exhibit a preference for the English language due to their pre-training dataset composition.

Unlike the Euclidean distance, DTW can compare time series of variable size and is robust to shifts or dilatations across the time dimension. To compute DTW, one typically solves a minimal-cost alignment problem between two time series using dynamic programming. Our work takes advantage of a smoothed formulation of DTW, called soft-DTW, that computes the soft-minimum of all alignment costs. We show in this paper that soft-DTW is a differentiable loss function, and that both its value and gradient can be computed with quadratic time/space complexity (DTW has quadratic time but linear space complexity). We show that this regular-ization is particularly well suited to average and cluster time series under the DTW geometry, a task for which our proposal significantly outperforms existing baselines (Petitjean et al., 2011). Next, we propose to tune the parameters of a machine that outputs time series by minimizing its fit with ground-truth labels in a soft-DTW sense.},

  abstract = {When training neural networks, the use of Synthetic Gradients (SG) allows layers or modules to be trained without update locking - without waiting for a true error gradient to be backpropagated - resulting in Decoupled Neural Interfaces (DNIs). This unlocked ability of being able to update parts of a neural network asynchronously and with only local information was demonstrated to work empirically in Jaderberg et al (2016). However, there has been very little demonstration of what changes DNIs and SGs impose from a functional, representational, and learning dynamics point of view. In this paper, we study DNIs through the use of synthetic gradients on feed-forward networks to better understand their behaviour and elucidate their effect on optimisation. We show that the incorporation of SGs does not affect the representational strength of the learning system for a neural network, and prove the convergence of the learning system for linear and deep linear models. On practical problems we investigate the mechanism by which synthetic gradient estimators approximate the true loss, and, surprisingly, how that leads to drastically different layer-wise representations. Finally, we also expose the relationship of using synthetic gradients to other error approximation techniques and find a unifying language for discussion and comparison.},

It consists of a segment-level recurrence mechanism and a novel positional encoding scheme. Our method not only enables capturing longer-term dependency, but also resolves the context fragmentation problem. As a result, Transformer-XL learns dependency that is 80\% longer than RNNs and 450\% longer than vanilla Transformers , achieves better performance on both short and long sequences, and is up to 1,800+ times faster than vanilla Transformers during evaluation. Notably, we improve the state-of-the-art results of bpc/perplexity to 0.99 on en-wiki8, 1.08 on text8, 18.3 on WikiText-103, 21.8 on One Billion Word, and 54.5 on Penn Treebank (without finetuning).

In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation.

  abstract = {Convolutional architectures have proven extremely successful for vision tasks. Their hard inductive biases enable sample-efficient learning, but come at the cost of a potentially lower performance ceiling. Vision Transformers (ViTs) rely on more flexible self-attention layers, and have recently outperformed CNNs for image classification. However, they require costly pre-training on large external datasets or distillation from pre-trained convolutional networks. In this paper, we ask the following question: is it possible to combine the strengths of these two architectures while avoiding their respective limitations? To this end, we introduce gated positional self-attention (GPSA), a form of positional self-attention which can be equipped with a ``soft" convolutional inductive bias. We initialise the GPSA layers to mimic the locality of convolutional layers, then give each attention head the freedom to escape locality by adjusting a gating parameter regulating the attention paid to position versus content information. The resulting convolutional-like ViT architecture, ConViT, outperforms the DeiT on ImageNet, while offering a much improved sample efficiency. We further investigate the role of locality in learning by first quantifying how it is encouraged in vanilla self-attention layers, then analysing how it is escaped in GPSA layers. We conclude by presenting various ablations to better understand the success of the ConViT. Our code and models are released publicly at https://github.com/facebookresearch/convit.},

Therefore, our novelty resides on the explicit modeling of 3D shape for document paper in an end-to-end pipeline. Also, we contribute the largest and most comprehensive dataset for document image unwarping to date-Doc3D. This dataset features multiple ground-truth annotations, including 3D shape, surface normals, UV map, albedo image, etc. Training with Doc3D, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for DewarpNet with extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

  abstract = {Deep learning models frequently trade handcrafted features for deep features learned with much less human intervention using gradient descent. While this paradigm has been enormously successful, deep networks are often difficult to train and performance can depend crucially on the initial choice of parameters. In this work, we introduce an algorithm called MetaInit as a step towards automating the search for good initializations using meta-learning. Our approach is based on a hypothesis that good initializations make gradient descent easier by starting in regions that look locally linear with minimal second order effects. We formalize this notion via a quantity that we call the gradient quotient, which can be computed with any architecture or dataset. MetaInit minimizes this quantity efficiently by using gradient descent to tune the norms of the initial weight matrices. We conduct experiments on plain and residual networks and show that the algorithm can automatically recover from a class of bad initializations. MetaInit allows us to train networks and achieve performance competitive with the state-of-the-art without batch normalization or residual connections. In particular, we find that this approach outperforms normalization for networks without skip connections on CIFAR-10 and can scale to Resnet-50 models on Imagenet.},

But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called ``ImageNet'', a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500--1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk.

  abstract = {In the framework of online cursive handwriting recognition, we present an efficient method for reordering the sequence of strokes composing handwriting in two special cases of interest: the horizontal bar of the character "t" and the dot of the character "i". The proposed method exploits shape information for selecting the strokes that most likely correspond to the features of interest, and layout and topological information for locating the strokes representing the body of the characters to which the features belong to. The method does not depend on the specific algorithm used for detecting the elementary strokes in which the electronic ink may be decomposed into. The performance of our method, evaluated on a data set of cursive words produced by 50 different writers, has shown a correct reordering of the sequence in more than 85\% of the cases. Thus, the proposed method allows obtaining a more stable and invariant description of the electronic ink in terms of elementary stroke sequences, and therefore can be helpfully used as a preprocessing step for both segmentation-based and word-based handwriting recognition systems.},

Unlike most approaches targeting specific domains such as scene-text or handwritten documents, we investigate the general problem of developing a universal architecture that can extract text from any image, regardless of source or input modality. We consider two decoder families (Connectionist Temporal Classification and Transformer) and three encoder modules (Bidirectional LSTMs, Self-Attention, and GRCLs), and conduct extensive experiments to compare their accuracy and performance on widely used public datasets of scene and handwritten text. We find that a combination that so far has received little attention in the literature, namely a Self-Attention encoder coupled with the CTC decoder, when compounded with an external language model and trained on both public and internal data, outperforms all the others in accuracy and computational complexity. Unlike the more common Transformer-based models, this architecture can handle inputs of arbitrary length, a requirement for universal line recognition. Using an internal dataset collected from multiple sources, we also expose the limitations of current public datasets in evaluating the accuracy of line recognizers, as the relatively narrow image width and sequence length distributions do not allow to observe the quality degradation of the Transformer approach when applied to the transcription of long lines.},

To mitigate the issue, we propose a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to generate training samples. This model conditions on a printed glyph image and creates mappings between printed characters and handwritten images, thus enabling the generation of photo-realistic handwritten samples with diverse styles and unseen text contents. However, the text contents in synthetic images are not always consistent with the glyph conditional images, leading to unreliable labels of synthetic samples. To address this issue, we further propose a progressive data filtering strategy to add those samples with a high confidence of correctness to the training set. Experimental results on IAM benchmark task show that OCR model trained with augmented DDPM-synthesized training samples can achieve about 45\% relative word error rate reduction compared with the one trained on real data only.},

However, this requires correcting for separating strokes, and detecting starting points. Moreover, ambiguousness at junction points increases the complexity of finding the smoothest paths. In order to resolve these issues, an effective approach that can simultaneously detect the points to separate strokes and find the optimal path for each stroke is proposed. To reduce the complexity of the problem, the skeleton graph of the handwritten image is used, and touching characters or crossing strokes are separated. Touches or crossings of stroke parts at ambiguous zones are detected and the smoothness values are adjusted to improve the accuracy. The greedy algorithm and Dijkstra'salgorithm with a well-defined function of smoothness are applied in searching the optimal path. The nature of the recovery is increased when the optimal path is split into many strokes by using the curvatures of the edges, the un-smoothness between edges and the appearance of double-traced edges. Finally, pixel sequences of strokes are extracted and ordered by using rules of handwriting. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through low error rates of pixel sequence comparison and high accuracy of online recognition.},

However, explaining why this is the case is still an open area of research. One standing hypothesis that is gaining popularity, e.g. Hochreiter \& Schmidhuber (1997); Keskar et al. (2017), is that the flatness of minima of the loss function found by stochastic gradient based methods results in good generalization. This paper argues that most notions of flatness are problematic for deep models and can not be directly applied to explain generalization. Specifically, when focusing on deep networks with rectifier units, we can exploit the particular geometry of parameter space induced by the inherent symmetries that these architectures exhibit to build equivalent models corresponding to arbitrarily sharper minima. Furthermore, if we allow to reparametrize a function, the geometry of its parameters can change drastically without affecting its generalization properties.},

Existing bug detection tools are based mainly on static analyzers, which rely on mathematical logic and symbolic reasoning about the program execution to detect common types of bugs. Fixing bugs is typically left out to the developer. In this work we introduce DeepDebug: a data-driven program repair approach which learns to detect and fix bugs in Java methods mined from real-world GitHub repositories. We frame bug-patching as a sequence-to-sequence learning task consisting of two steps: (i) denoising pretraining, and (ii) supervised finetuning on the target translation task. We show that pretraining on source code programs improves the number of patches found by 33\% as compared to supervised training from scratch, while domain-adaptive pretraining from natural language to code further improves the accuracy by another 32\%. We refine the standard accuracy evaluation metric into non-deletion and deletion-only fixes, and show that our best model generates 75\% more non-deletion fixes than the previous state of the art. In contrast to prior work, we attain our best results when generating raw code, as opposed to working with abstracted code that tends to only benefit smaller capacity models. Finally, we observe a subtle improvement from adding syntax embeddings along with the standard positional embeddings, as well as with adding an auxiliary task to predict each token's syntactic class. Despite focusing on Java, our approach is language agnostic, requiring only a general-purpose parser such as tree-sitter.},

In theoretical neuroscience, different kinds of attractor neural networks have been associated with different functions, such as memory, motor behavior, and classification. Describing networks as attractor networks allows researchers to employ methods of dynamical systems theory to quantitatively analyze their characteristics (e.g. stability, robustness, etc.).    More precisely, an attractor network is a set of N network nodes connected in such a way that their global dynamics becomes stable in a D dimensional space, where usually N{$>>$}D.

The model can be jointly trained by a variant of target propagation across layers, without the need to derive back-propagation nor differentiability. Experiments confirmed the effectiveness of the model in terms of performance and representation learning ability.},

  abstract = {Describes a system developed at NIST to produce a composite automatic speech recognition (ASR) system output when the outputs of multiple ASR systems are available, and for which, in many cases, the composite ASR output has a lower error rate than any of the individual systems. The system implements a "voting" or rescoring process to reconcile differences in ASR system outputs. We refer to this system as the NIST Recognizer Output Voting Error Reduction (ROVER) system. As additional knowledge sources are added to an ASR system (e.g. acoustic and language models), error rates are typically decreased. This paper describes a post-recognition process which models the output generated by multiple ASR systems as independent knowledge sources that can be combined and used to generate an output with reduced error rate. To accomplish this, the outputs of multiple of ASR systems are combined into a single, minimal-cost word transition network (WTN) via iterative applications of dynamic programming (DP) alignments. The resulting network is searched by an automatic rescoring or "voting" process that selects the output sequence with the lowest score.},

  abstract = {The modern project of creating human-like artificial intelligence (AI) started after World War II, when it was discovered that electronic computers are not just number-crunching machines, but can also manipulate symbols. It is possible to pursue this goal without assuming that machine intelligence is identical to human intelligence. This is known as weak AI. However, many AI researcher have pursued the aim of developing artificial intelligence that is in principle identical to human intelligence, called strong AI. Weak AI is less ambitious than strong AI, and therefore less controversial. However, there are important controversies related to weak AI as well. This paper focuses on the distinction between artificial general intelligence (AGI) and artificial narrow intelligence (ANI). Although AGI may be classified as weak AI, it is close to strong AI because one chief characteristics of human intelligence is its generality. Although AGI is less ambitious than strong AI, there were critics almost from the very beginning. One of the leading critics was the philosopher Hubert Dreyfus, who argued that computers, who have no body, no childhood and no cultural practice, could not acquire intelligence at all. One of Dreyfus' main arguments was that human knowledge is partly tacit, and therefore cannot be articulated and incorporated in a computer program. However, today one might argue that new approaches to artificial intelligence research have made his arguments obsolete. Deep learning and Big Data are among the latest approaches, and advocates argue that they will be able to realize AGI. A closer look reveals that although development of artificial intelligence for specific purposes (ANI) has been impressive, we have not come much closer to developing artificial general intelligence (AGI). The article further argues that this is in principle impossible, and it revives Hubert Dreyfus' argument that computers are not in the world.}

This is especially true for handwritten text recognition (HTR), where each author has a unique style, unlike printed text, where the variation is smaller by design. That said, deep learning based HTR is limited, as in every other task, by the number of training examples. Gathering data is a challenging and costly task, and even more so, the labeling task that follows, of which we focus here. One possible approach to reduce the burden of data annotation is semi-supervised learning. Semi supervised methods use, in addition to labeled data, some unlabeled samples to improve performance, compared to fully supervised ones. Consequently , such methods may adapt to unseen images during test time. We present ScrabbleGAN, a semi-supervised approach to synthesize handwritten text images that are versatile both in style and lexicon. ScrabbleGAN relies on a novel gener-ative model which can generate images of words with an arbitrary length. We show how to operate our approach in a semi-supervised manner, enjoying the aforementioned benefits such as performance boost over state of the art supervised HTR. Furthermore, our generator can manipulate the resulting text style. This allows us to change, for instance , whether the text is cursive, or how thin is the pen stroke.},

These metrics compare images in terms of their low-level colors and textures, but fail to capture mid-level similarities and differences in image layout, object pose, and semantic content. In this paper, we develop a perceptual metric that assesses images holistically. Our first step is to collect a new dataset of human similarity judgments over image pairs that are alike in diverse ways. Critical to this dataset is that judgments are nearly automatic and shared by all observers. To achieve this we use recent text-to-image models to create synthetic pairs that are perturbed along various dimensions. We observe that popular perceptual metrics fall short of explaining our new data, and we introduce a new metric, DreamSim, tuned to better align with human perception. We analyze how our metric is affected by different visual attributes, and find that it focuses heavily on foreground objects and semantic content while also being sensitive to color and layout. Notably, despite being trained on synthetic data, our metric generalizes to real images, giving strong results on retrieval and reconstruction tasks. Furthermore, our metric outperforms both prior learned metrics and recent large vision models on these tasks.},

Masked auto-encoding for feature pretraining and multi-scale hybrid convolution-transformer architectures can further unleash the potentials of ViT, leading to state-of-the-art performances on image classification, detection and semantic segmentation. In this paper, our ConvMAE framework demonstrates that multi-scale hybrid convolution-transformer can learn more discriminative representations via the mask auto-encoding scheme. However, directly using the original masking strategy leads to the heavy computational cost and pretraining-finetuning discrepancy. To tackle the issue, we adopt the masked convolution to prevent information leakage in the convolution blocks. A simple block-wise masking strategy is proposed to ensure computational efficiency. We also propose to more directly supervise the multi-scale features of the encoder to boost multi-scale features. Based on our pretrained ConvMAE models, ConvMAE-Base improves ImageNet-1K finetuning accuracy by 1.4\% compared with MAE-Base. On object detection, ConvMAE-Base finetuned for only 25 epochs surpasses MAE-Base fined-tuned for 100 epochs by 2.9\% box AP and 2.2\% mask AP respectively.

Shortcuts are decision rules that perform well on standard benchmarks but fail to transfer to more challenging testing conditions, such as real-world scenarios. Related issues are known in comparative psychology, education and linguistics, suggesting that shortcut learning may be a common characteristic of learning systems, biological and artificial alike. Based on these observations, we develop a set of recommendations for model interpretation and benchmarking, highlighting recent advances in machine learning to improve robustness and transferability from the lab to real-world applications.},

For evaluation, we train deep networks on synthetic datasets produced in different ways and measure their performance on the DIBCO datasets.

However, directly training the vision transformers may yield unstable and sub-optimal results. Recent works propose to improve the performance of the vision transformers by modifying the transformer structures, e.g., incorporating convolution layers. In contrast, we investigate an orthogonal approach to stabilize the vision transformer training without modifying the networks. We observe the instability of the training can be attributed to the significant similarity across the extracted patch representations. More specifically, for deep vision transformers, the self-attention blocks tend to map different patches into similar latent representations, yielding information loss and performance degradation. To alleviate this problem, in this work, we introduce novel loss functions in vision transformer training to explicitly encourage diversity across patch representations for more discriminative feature extraction. We empirically show that our proposed techniques stabilize the training and allow us to train wider and deeper vision transformers. We further show the diversified features significantly benefit the downstream tasks in transfer learning. For semantic segmentation, we enhance the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on Cityscapes and ADE20k. Our code is available at https://github.com/ChengyueGongR/PatchVisionTransformer.},

  abstract = {The ability to backpropagate stochastic gradients through continuous latent distributions has been crucial to the emergence of variational autoencoders and stochastic gradient variational Bayes. The key ingredient is an unbiased and low-variance way of estimating gradients with respect to distribution parameters from gradients evaluated at distribution samples. The "reparameterization trick" provides a class of transforms yielding such estimators for many continuous distributions, including the Gaussian and other members of the location-scale family. However the trick does not readily extend to mixture density models, due to the difficulty of reparameterizing the discrete distribution over mixture weights. This report describes an alternative transform, applicable to any continuous multivariate distribution with a differentiable density function from which samples can be drawn, and uses it to derive an unbiased estimator for mixture density weight derivatives. Combined with the reparameterization trick applied to the individual mixture components, this estimator makes it straightforward to train variational autoencoders with mixture-distributed latent variables, or to perform stochastic variational inference with a mixture density variational posterior.},

While state-of-the art methods rely on negative pairs, BYOL achieves a new state of the art without them. BYOL reaches 74.3\% top-1 classification accuracy on ImageNet using a linear evaluation with a ResNet-50 architecture and 79.6\% with a larger ResNet. We show that BYOL performs on par or better than the current state of the art on both transfer and semi-supervised benchmarks. Our implementation and pretrained models are given on GitHub.},

To fill this gap, we introduce ShabbyPages, a new document image dataset designed for training and benchmarking document denoisers and binarizers. ShabbyPages contains over 6,000 clean "born digital" images with synthetically-noised counterparts ("shabby pages") that were augmented using the Augraphy document augmentation tool to appear as if they have been printed and faxed, photocopied, or otherwise altered through physical processes. In this paper, we discuss the creation process of ShabbyPages and demonstrate the utility of ShabbyPages by training convolutional denoisers which remove real noise features with a high degree of human-perceptible fidelity, establishing baseline performance for a new ShabbyPages benchmark.},

In a first stage, a deep neural network called ARU-Net labels pixels to belong to one of the three classes: baseline, separator and other. The separator class marks beginning and end of each text line. The ARU-Net is trainable from scratch with manageably few manually annotated example images (\$\${$<\backslash$},50\$\$). This is achieved by utilizing data augmentation strategies. The network predictions are used as input for the second stage which performs a bottom-up clustering to build baselines. The developed method is capable of handling complex layouts as well as curved and arbitrarily oriented text lines. It substantially outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches. For example, for the complex track of the cBAD: ICDAR2017 Competition on Baseline Detection the F value is increased from 0.859 to 0.922. The framework to train and run the ARU-Net is open source.},

  abstract = {Handwritten text recognition has been a ubiquitous research problem in the field of computer vision. Most existing approaches focus on the recognition of handwritten words without considering the cursive nature and significant differences in the writing of individuals. In this paper, we address these problems by leveraging an adaptive context-aware reinforced agent which learns the actions to determine the scales of context regions during inference. We formulate our approach in a reinforcement learning framework. Specifically, we construct the action set with a number of context lengths. Given an image feature sequence, our model is trained to adaptively choose the optimal context length according to the observed state. An attention mechanism is then used to selectively attend the context region. Our model can generalize well from recognizing isolated words to recognizing individual lines of text while remain low computation overheads. We conduct extensive experiments on three large-scale handwritten text recognition datasets. The experimental results show that our proposed model is superior to the state-of-the-art alternatives.},

While modern optical character recognition (OCR) engines are proficient with printed text, their performance on handwriting is limited, often requiring costly labeled data for fine-tuning. In this paper, we explore the use of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for transcribing multi-page handwritten documents in a zero-shot setting. We investigate various configurations of commercial OCR engines and MLLMs, utilizing the latter both as end-to-end transcribers and as post-processors, with and without image components. We propose a novel method, '+first page', which enhances MLLM transcription by providing the OCR output of the entire document along with just the first page image. This approach leverages shared document features without incurring the high cost of processing all images. Experiments on a multi-page version of the IAM Handwriting Database demonstrate that '+first page' improves transcription accuracy, balances cost with performance, and even enhances results on out-of-sample text by extrapolating formatting and OCR error patterns from a single page.},

We present a multilingual study of the linguistic knowledge encoded in RNNs trained as character-level language models, on input data with word boundaries removed. These networks face a tougher and more cognitively realistic task, having to discover any useful linguistic unit from scratch based on input statistics. The results show that our "near tabula rasa" RNNs are mostly able to solve morphological, syntactic and semantic tasks that intuitively presuppose word-level knowledge, and indeed they learned, to some extent, to track word boundaries. Our study opens the door to speculations about the necessity of an explicit , rigid word lexicon in language learning and usage.},

The variability means that naive example-based texture synthesis can be conspicuously repetitive. We propose an algorithm that renders a desired input string in an author's handwriting. An annotated sample of the author's handwriting is required; the system is flexible enough that historical documents can usually be used with only a little extra effort. Experiments show that our glyph-centric approach, with learned parameters for spacing, line thickness, and pressure, produces novel images of handwriting that look hand-made to casual observers, even when printed on paper.},

  abstract = {Word detection is considered an object detection problem. However, characters are the basic building block in words, and the presence of characters makes word detection different from general object detection problems. Character region scores identification performs consistently for handwritten text in low-contrast camera-captured images, But detecting words from characters poses a challenge because of variable character spacing in words. Nevertheless, considering the only character and ignoring a word's entirety does not cope with overlapping words in handwriting text. In our work, we propose the fusion of character region scores with word detection. Since the character level annotations are not available for handwritten text, we estimate the character region scores in a weakly supervised manner. Character region scores are estimated autonomously from the word's bounding box estimation to learn the character level information in handwriting. We propose to fuse the character region scores and images to detect words in camera-captured handwriting images. Fusion of character region score with image has a higher recall of 88.4(+1.2) and outperforms the state of the state-of-the-art object detector with 92.2(+0.4) mAP@0.5 and 64.0(+0.4) mAP@0.5:0.95.

Instead, we introduce a new structured graph convolution operator that can copy 2D convolution weights, transferring the capabilities of already trained traditional CNNs to our new graph network. This network can then operate on any data that can be represented as a positional graph. By converting non-rectilinear data to a graph, we can apply these convolutions on these irregular image domains without requiring training on large domain-specific datasets. Results of transferring pre-trained image networks for segmentation, stylization, and depth prediction are demonstrated for a variety of such data forms.},

  abstract = {This paper shows that masked autoencoders (MAE) are scalable self-supervised learners for computer vision. Our MAE approach is simple: we mask random patches of the input image and reconstruct the missing pixels. It is based on two core designs. First, we develop an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture, with an encoder that operates only on the visible subset of patches (without mask tokens), along with a lightweight decoder that reconstructs the original image from the latent representation and mask tokens. Second, we find that masking a high proportion of the input image, e.g., 75\%, yields a nontrivial and meaningful self-supervisory task. Coupling these two designs enables us to train large models efficiently and effectively: we accelerate training (by 3x or more) and improve accuracy. Our scalable approach allows for learning high-capacity models that generalize well: e.g., a vanilla ViT-Huge model achieves the best accuracy (87.8\%) among methods that use only ImageNet-1K data. Transfer performance in downstream tasks outperforms supervised pre-training and shows promising scaling behavior.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we study the problem of text line recognition. Unlike most approaches targeting specific domains such as scene-text or handwritten documents, we investigate the general problem of developing a universal architecture that can extract text from any image, regardless of source or input modality. We consider two decoder families (Connectionist Temporal Classification and Transformer) and three encoder modules (Bidirectional LSTMs, Self-Attention, and GRCLs), and conduct extensive experiments to compare their accuracy and performance on widely used public datasets of scene and handwritten text. We find that a combination that so far has received little attention in the literature, namely a Self-Attention encoder coupled with the CTC decoder, when compounded with an external language model and trained on both public and internal data, outperforms all the others in accuracy and computational complexity. Unlike the more common Transformer-based models, this architecture can handle inputs of arbitrary length, a requirement for universal line recognition. Using an internal dataset collected from multiple sources, we also expose the limitations of current public datasets in evaluating the accuracy of line recognizers, as the relatively narrow image width and sequence length distributions do not allow to observe the quality degradation of the Transformer approach when applied to the transcription of long lines.},

We brieey review Hochreiter's 1991 analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, eecient, gradient-based method called {\textbackslash}Long Short-Term Memory" (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete time steps by enforcing constant error ow through {\textbackslash}constant error carrousels" within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error ow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with artiicial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with RTRL, BPTT, Recurrent Cascade-Correlation, Elman nets, and Neural Sequence Chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artiicial long time lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

  abstract = {Gaussian multiplicative noise is commonly used as a stochastic regularisation technique in training of deterministic neural networks. A recent paper reinterpreted the technique as a specific algorithm for approximate inference in Bayesian neural networks; several extensions ensued. We show that the log-uniform prior used in all the above publications does not generally induce a proper posterior, and thus Bayesian inference in such models is ill-posed. Independent of the log-uniform prior, the correlated weight noise approximation has further issues leading to either infinite objective or high risk of overfitting. The above implies that the reported sparsity of obtained solutions cannot be explained by Bayesian or the related minimum description length arguments. We thus study the objective from a non-Bayesian perspective, provide its previously unknown analytical form which allows exact gradient evaluation, and show that the later proposed additive reparametrisation introduces minima not present in the original multiplicative parametrisation. Implications and future research directions are discussed.},

  abstract = {Gatys et al. recently introduced a neural algorithm that renders a content image in the style of another image, achieving so-called style transfer. However, their framework requires a slow iterative optimization process, which limits its practical application. Fast approximations with feed-forward neural networks have been proposed to speed up neural style transfer. Unfortunately, the speed improvement comes at a cost: the network is usually tied to a fixed set of styles and cannot adapt to arbitrary new styles. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective approach that for the first time enables arbitrary style transfer in real-time. At the heart of our method is a novel adaptive instance normaliza-tion (AdaIN) layer that aligns the mean and variance of the content features with those of the style features. Our method achieves speed comparable to the fastest existing approach, without the restriction to a pre-defined set of styles. In addition , our approach allows flexible user controls such as content-style trade-off, style interpolation, color \& spatial controls, all using a single feed-forward neural network.},

Most multimodal pre-trained models use a masked language modeling objective to learn bidirectional representations on the text modality, but they differ in pre-training objectives for the image modality. This discrepancy adds difficulty to multimodal representation learning. In this paper, we propose LayoutLMv3 to pre-train multimodal Transformers for Document AI with unified text and image masking. Additionally, LayoutLMv3 is pre-trained with a word-patch alignment objective to learn cross-modal alignment by predicting whether the corresponding image patch of a text word is masked. The simple unified architecture and training objectives make LayoutLMv3 a general-purpose pre-trained model for both text-centric and image-centric Document AI tasks. Experimental results show that LayoutLMv3 achieves state-of-the-art performance not only in text-centric tasks, including form understanding, receipt understanding, and document visual question answering, but also in image-centric tasks such as document image classification and document layout analysis.

We demonstrate that this approach is effective at synthesizing photos from label maps, reconstructing objects from edge maps, and colorizing images, among other tasks. Indeed, since the release of the pix2pix software associated with this paper, a large number of internet users (many of them artists) have posted their own experiments with our system, further demonstrating its wide applicability and ease of adoption without the need for parameter tweaking. As a community, we no longer hand-engineer our mapping functions, and this work suggests we can achieve reasonable results without hand-engineering our loss functions either.},

  abstract = {Training directed neural networks typically requires forward-propagating data through a computation graph, followed by backpropagating error signal, to produce weight updates. All layers , or more generally, modules, of the network are therefore locked, in the sense that they must wait for the remainder of the network to execute forwards and propagate error backwards before they can be updated. In this work we break this constraint by decoupling modules by introducing a model of the future computation of the network graph. These models predict what the result of the modelled subgraph will produce using only local information. In particular we focus on modelling error gradients: by using the modelled synthetic gradient in place of true backpropa-gated error gradients we decouple subgraphs, and can update them independently and asyn-chronously i.e. we realise decoupled neural interfaces. We show results for feed-forward models , where every layer is trained asynchronously, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) where predicting one's future gradient extends the time over which the RNN can effectively model, and also a hierarchical RNN system with ticking at different timescales. Finally, we demonstrate that in addition to predicting gradients, the same framework can be used to predict inputs, resulting in models which are decoupled in both the forward and backwards pass-amounting to independent networks which co-learn such that they can be composed into a single functioning corporation.},

This differentiable module can be inserted into existing convolutional architectures, giving neural networks the ability to actively spatially transform feature maps, conditional on the feature map itself, without any extra training supervision or modification to the optimisation process. We show that the use of spatial transformers results in models which learn invariance to translation, scale, rotation and more generic warping, resulting in state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, and for a number of classes of transformations.},

Along with the discriminator patchGAN in pix2pix model, a pipeline has been developed to extract the patches from input images, predict clean patches using the trained model and finally merge the output patches smoothly. For training, a noisy scanned document dataset created by synthetically adding noises has been utilized to clean the images. Finally, the proposed model is tested by performing quantitative analysis based on different metrics - Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) as well as qualitative analysis by using OCR test on test dataset and real-time documents.},

The numerical experiments show the effectivity of the new model. Moreover, comparing with sole handwriting generator, the HWGANs synthesize more natural and realistic handwritten text.},

  abstract = {We present a method that separates handwritten and machine-printed components that are mixed and overlapped in documents. Many conventional methods addressed this problem by extracting connected components (CCs) and classifying the extracted CCs into two classes. They were based on the assumption that two types of components are not overlapping each other, while we are focusing on more challenging and realistic cases where the components are often overlapping each other. For this, we propose a new method that performs pixel-level classification with a convolutional neural network. Unlike conventional neural network methods, our method works in an end-to-end manner and does not require any preprocessing steps (e.g., foreground extraction, handcrafted feature extraction, and so on). For the training of our network, we develop a cross-entropy based loss function to alleviate the class imbalance problem. Regarding the training dataset, although there are some datasets of mixed printed characters and handwritten scripts, most of them do not have overlapping cases and do not provide pixel-level annotations. Hence, we also propose a data synthesis method that generates realistic pixel-level training samples having many overlappings of printed and handwritten components. Experimental results on synthetic and real images have shown the effectiveness of the proposed method. Although the proposed network has been trained only with synthetic images, it also improves the OCR rate of real documents. Specifically, the OCR rate for machine-printed texts is increased from 0.8087 to 0.9442 by removing the overlapped handwritten scribbles by our method.},

We first show that larger models are well-calibrated on diverse multiple choice and true/false questions when they are provided in the right format. Thus we can approach self-evaluation on open-ended sampling tasks by asking models to first propose answers, and then to evaluate the probability "P(True)" that their answers are correct. We find encouraging performance, calibration, and scaling for P(True) on a diverse array of tasks. Performance at self-evaluation further improves when we allow models to consider many of their own samples before predicting the validity of one specific possibility. Next, we investigate whether models can be trained to predict "P(IK)", the probability that "I know" the answer to a question, without reference to any particular proposed answer. Models perform well at predicting P(IK) and partially generalize across tasks, though they struggle with calibration of P(IK) on new tasks. The predicted P(IK) probabilities also increase appropriately in the presence of relevant source materials in the context, and in the presence of hints towards the solution of mathematical word problems. We hope these observations lay the groundwork for training more honest models, and for investigating how honesty generalizes to cases where models are trained on objectives other than the imitation of human writing.},

  abstract = {Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) is still a challenging problem because it must deal with two important difficulties: the variability among writing styles, and the scarcity of labelled data. To alleviate such problems, synthetic data generation and data augmentation are typically used to train HTR systems. However, training with such data produces encouraging but still inaccurate transcriptions in real words. In this paper, we propose an unsuper-vised writer adaptation approach that is able to automatically adjust a generic handwritten word recognizer, fully trained with synthetic fonts, towards a new incoming writer. We have experimentally validated our proposal using five different datasets, covering several challenges (i) the document source: modern and historic samples, which may involve paper degradation problems; (ii) different handwriting styles: single and multiple writer collections; and (iii) language, which involves different character combinations. Across these challenging collections, we show that our system is able to maintain its performance, thus, it provides a practical and generic approach to deal with new document collections without requiring any expensive and tedious manual annotation step.},

On the contrary, when writing by hand, a great variability is observed across different writers, and even when analyzing words scribbled by the same individual, involuntary variations are conspicuous. In this work, we take a step closer to producing realistic and varied artificially rendered handwritten words. We propose a novel method that is able to produce credible handwritten word images by conditioning the generative process with both calligraphic style features and textual content. Our generator is guided by three complementary learning objectives: to produce realistic images, to imitate a certain handwriting style and to convey a specific textual content. Our model is unconstrained to any predefined vocabulary, being able to render whatever input word. Given a sample writer, it is also able to mimic its calligraphic features in a few-shot setup. We significantly advance over prior art and demonstrate with qualitative, quantitative and human-based evaluations the realistic aspect of our synthetically produced images.},

  abstract = {The Hausdorff Distance (HD) is widely used in evaluating medical image segmentation methods. However, existing segmentation methods do not attempt to reduce HD directly. In this paper, we present novel loss functions for training convolutional neural network (CNN)-based segmentation methods with the goal of reducing HD directly. We propose three methods to estimate HD from the segmentation probability map produced by a CNN. One method makes use of the distance transform of the segmentation boundary. Another method is based on applying morphological erosion on the difference between the true and estimated segmentation maps. The third method works by applying circular/spherical convolution kernels of different radii on the segmentation probability maps. Based on these three methods for estimating HD, we suggest three loss functions that can be used for training to reduce HD. We use these loss functions to train CNNs for segmentation of the prostate, liver, and pancreas in ultrasound, magnetic resonance, and computed tomography images and compare the results with commonly-used loss functions. Our results show that the proposed loss functions can lead to approximately 18-45 \% reduction in HD without degrading other segmentation performance criteria such as the Dice similarity coefficient. The proposed loss functions can be used for training medical image segmentation methods in order to reduce the large segmentation errors.},

Interpreting all signals in the network as continuous, we derive generally applicable, small architectural changes that guarantee that unwanted information cannot leak into the hierarchical synthesis process. The resulting networks match the FID of StyleGAN2 but differ dramatically in their internal representations, and they are fully equivariant to translation and rotation even at subpixel scales.

Second, our metaphysical claim is that the existence of LLM credences is at least plausible, although current evidence is inconclusive. Third, our epistemic claim is that LLM credence attributions made in the empirical literature on LLM evaluation are subject to non-trivial sceptical concerns. It is a distinct possibility that even if LLMs have credences, LLM credence attributions are generally false because the experimental techniques used to assess LLM credences are not truth-tracking.},

  abstract = {Miscalibration in Large Language Models (LLMs) undermines their reliability, highlighting the need for accurate confidence estimation. We introduce CCPS (Calibrating LLM Confidence by Probing Perturbed Representation Stability), a novel method analyzing internal representational stability in LLMs. CCPS applies targeted adversarial perturbations to final hidden states, extracts features reflecting the model's response to these perturbations, and uses a lightweight classifier to predict answer correctness. CCPS was evaluated on LLMs from 8B to 32B parameters (covering Llama, Qwen, and Mistral architectures) using MMLU and MMLU-Pro benchmarks in both multiple-choice and open-ended formats. Our results show that CCPS significantly outperforms current approaches. Across four LLMs and three MMLU variants, CCPS reduces Expected Calibration Error by approximately 55\% and Brier score by 21\%, while increasing accuracy by 5 percentage points, Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve by 4 percentage points, and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve by 6 percentage points, all relative to the strongest prior method. CCPS delivers an efficient, broadly applicable, and more accurate solution for estimating LLM confidence, thereby improving their trustworthiness.},

Despite its abundant lateral and feedback connections, object processing is commonly viewed and studied as a feedforward process. Here, we measure and model the rapid representational dynamics across multiple stages of the human ventral stream using time-resolved brain imaging and deep learning. We observe substantial representational transformations during the first 300 ms of processing within and across ventral-stream regions. Categorical divisions emerge in sequence, cascading forward and in reverse across regions, and Granger causality analysis suggests bidirectional information flow between regions. Finally, recurrent deep neural network models clearly outperform parameter-matched feedforward models in terms of their ability to capture the multi-region cortical dynamics. Targeted virtual cooling experiments on the recurrent deep network models further substantiate the importance of their lateral and top-down connections. These results establish that recurrent models are required to understand information processing in the human ventral stream.},

Based on CER and BLEU, we demonstrate that LLMs outperform the conventional OCR/HTR methods. Moreover, we also compare the evaluated CER and BLEU scores to human evaluations to better judge the outputs of whole-scan experiments and understand influential factors for CER and BLEU. Combining judgments from all the evaluation metrics, we conclude that two-shot GPT-4o for line-by-line images and two-shot Claude Sonnet 3.5 for whole-scan images yield the transcriptions of the historical records most similar to the ground truth.},

However, because ViT has a different architectural design than CNN, it may behave differently. To investigate whether ViT has a different performance or robustness, we tested ViT and CNN under various imaging conditions in practical vision tasks. We confirmed that for most image transformations, ViT's robustness was comparable or even better than that of CNN. However, for contrast enhancement, ViT performed particularly poorly. We show that this is because positional embedding in ViT's patch embedding can work improperly when the color scale changes. We demonstrate that the use of PreLayerNorm, a modified patch embedding structure, ensures the consistent behavior of ViT. Results demonstrate that ViT with PreLayerNorm exhibited improved robustness in the contrast-varying environments.},

Current Visual Document Understanding (VDU) methods outsource the task of reading text to off-the-shelf Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engines and focus on the understanding task with the OCR outputs. Although such OCR-based approaches have shown promising performance, they suffer from 1) high computational costs for using OCR; 2) inflexibility of OCR models on languages or types of documents; 3) OCR error propagation to the subsequent process. To address these issues, in this paper, we introduce a novel OCR-free VDU model named Donut, which stands for Document understanding transformer. As the first step in OCR-free VDU research, we propose a simple architecture (i.e., Transformer) with a pre-training objective (i.e., cross-entropy loss). Donut is conceptually simple yet effective. Through extensive experiments and analyses, we show a simple OCR-free VDU model, Donut, achieves state-of-the-art performances on various VDU tasks in terms of both speed and accuracy. In addition, we offer a synthetic data generator that helps the model pre-training to be flexible in various languages and domains. The code, trained model, and synthetic data are available at .},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator.

We examine models on 5 datasets that evaluate various vision-language capabilities. Using conformal prediction as an uncertainty estimation approach, we demonstrate that the models' uncertainty is not aligned with their accuracy. Specifically, we show that models with the highest accuracy may also have the highest uncertainty, which confirms the importance of measuring it for VLMs. Our empirical findings also reveal a correlation between model uncertainty and its language model part.},

Researchers in academic settings as well as in startup companies such as Deep Genomics, launched July 22, 2015, by some of the authors of DeepBind, will increasingly apply deep learning to genome analysis and precision medicine. The goal is to predict the effect of genetic variants--- both naturally occurring and introduced by genome editing---on a cell's regulatory landscape and how this in turn affects dis-ease development. Nicole Rusk ❯❯Deep learning New computational tools learn complex motifs from large sequence data sets. A powerful form of machine learning that enables computers to solve perceptual problems such as image and speech rec-ognition is increasingly making an entry into the biological sciences. These deep-learning methods, such as deep artificial neural networks, use multiple processing layers to discover patterns and structure in very large data sets. Each layer learns a concept from the data that subsequent lay-ers build on; the higher the level, the more abstract the concepts that are learned. Deep learning does not depend on prior data processing and automatically extracts features. To use a simple example, a deep neural network tasked with interpreting shapes would learn to recognize simple edges in the first layer and then add recog-nition of the more complex shapes com-posed of those edges in subsequent lay-ers. There is no hard and fast rule for how many layers are needed to constitute deep learning, but most experts agree that more than two are required. Recent examples show the power of deep learning to derive regulatory fea-tures in genomes from DNA sequence alone: DeepSEA (Nat. Methods 12, 931-- 934, 2015) uses genomic sequence as input, trains on chromatin profiles from large consortia such as ENCODE and the Epigenomics Roadmap, and predicts the effect of single-nucleotide variants on reg-ulatory regions such as DNase hypersen-sitive sites, transcription factor--binding sites and histone marks. Basset (bioRxiv, doi:10.1101/028399, 2015) uses similar deep neural networks to predict the effect of single-nucleotide polymorphisms on chromatin accessibility. DeepBind (Nat. Biotechnol. 33, 831--838, 2015) finds protein-binding sites on RNA and DNA and predicts the effects of mutations. Deep learning will be invaluable in the context of big data, as it extracts high-level information from very large volumes of data. As it gains traction in genome analy-sis, initial challenges such as overfitting due to rare dependencies in the training data},

  abstract = {Nonlinear principal component analysis is a novel technique for multivariate data analysis, similar to the well-known method of principal component analysis. NLPCA, like PCA, is used to identify and remove correlations among problem variables as an aid to dimensionality reduction, visualization, and exploratory data analysis. While PCA identifies only linear correlations between variables, NLPCA uncovers both linear and nonlinear correlations, without restriction on the character of the nonlinearities present in the data. NLPCA operates by training a feedforward neural network to perform the identity mapping, where the network inputs are reproduced at the output layer. The network contains an internal ``bottleneck'' layer (containing fewer nodes than input or output layers), which forces the network to develop a compact representation of the input data, and two additional hidden layers. The NLPCA method is demonstrated using time-dependent, simulated batch reaction data. Results show that NLPCA successfully reduces dimensionality and produces a feature space map resembling the actual distribution of the underlying system parameters.},

This has applications related to matching and mining in image collections containing handwritten content. A similarity score is computed by detecting patterns of text re-usages between document images irrespective of the minor variations in word morphology, word ordering, layout and paraphrasing of the content. Our method does not depend on an accurate segmentation of words and lines. We formulate the document matching problem as a structured comparison of the word distributions across two document images. To match two word images, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) based feature descriptor. Performance of this representation surpasses the state-of-the-art on handwritten word spotting. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our method on a practical problem of matching handwritten assignments.},

In the present paper we propose an unusual learning rule, which has a degree of biological plausibility and which is motivated by Hebb's idea that change of the synapse strength should be local---i.e., should depend only on the activities of the pre- and postsynaptic neurons. We design a learning algorithm that utilizes global inhibition in the hidden layer and is capable of learning early feature detectors in a completely unsupervised way. These learned lower-layer feature detectors can be used to train higher-layer weights in a usual supervised way so that the performance of the full network is comparable to the performance of standard feedforward networks trained end-to-end with a backpropagation algorithm on simple tasks.},

  abstract = {Deep convolutional artificial neural networks (ANNs) are the leading class of candidate models of the mechanisms of visual processing in the primate ventral stream. While initially inspired by brain anatomy, over the past years, these ANNs have evolved from a simple eight-layer architecture in AlexNet to extremely deep and branching architectures, demonstrating increasingly better object categorization performance, yet bringing into question how brain-like they still are. In particular, typical deep models from the machine learning community are often hard to map onto the brain's anatomy due to their vast number of layers and missing biologically-important connections, such as recurrence. Here we demonstrate that better anatomical alignment to the brain and high performance on machine learning as well as neuroscience measures do not have to be in contradiction. We developed CORnet-S, a shallow ANN with four anatomically mapped areas and recurrent connectivity, guided by Brain-Score, a new large-scale composite of neural and behavioral benchmarks for quantifying the functional fidelity of models of the primate ventral visual stream. Despite being significantly shallower than most models, CORnet-S is the top model on Brain-Score and outperforms similarly compact models on ImageNet. Moreover, our extensive analyses of CORnet-S circuitry variants reveal that recurrence is the main predictive factor of both Brain-Score and ImageNet top-1 performance. Finally, we report that the temporal evolution of the CORnet-S "IT" neural population resembles the actual monkey IT population dynamics. Taken together, these results establish CORnet-S, a compact, recurrent ANN, as the current best model of the primate ventral visual stream.},

The design of deep neu-ral network models makes it necessary to extend training datasets in order to introduce variations and increase the number of samples; word-retrieval is therefore very difficult in low-resource scripts. Much of the existing literature comprises preprocessing strategies which are seldom sufficient to cover all possible variations. We propose the Adversar-ial Feature Deformation Module (AFDM) that learns ways to elastically warp extracted features in a scalable manner. The AFDM is inserted between intermediate layers and trained alternatively with the original framework, boosting its capability to better learn highly informative features rather than trivial ones. We test our meta-framework, which is built on top of popular word-spotting and word-recognition frameworks and enhanced by the AFDM, not only on extensive Latin word datasets but also sparser Indic scripts. We record results for varying training data sizes, and observe that our enhanced network generalizes much better in the low-data regime; the overall word-error rates and mAP scores are observed to improve as well.},

Generally, online acquisition approach has more advantage than its offline counterpart as the online technique keeps track of the pen movement. Hence, pen tip trajectory retrieval from offline text can bridge the gap between online and offline methods. Our proposed framework employs sequence to sequence model which consists of an encoder-decoder LSTM module. Our encoder module consists of Convolutional LSTM network, which takes an offline character image as the input and encodes the feature sequence to a hidden representation. The output of the encoder is fed to a decoder LSTM and we get the successive coordinate points from every time step of the decoder LSTM. Although the sequence to sequence model is a popular paradigm in various computer vision and language translation tasks, the main contribution of our work lies in designing an end-to-end network for a decade old popular problem in Document Image Analysis community.

We argue that there is a risk in using RVL-CDIP for benchmarking document classifiers, as its limited scope, presence of errors (state-of-the-art models now achieve accuracy error rates that are within our estimated label error rate), and lack of diversity make it less than ideal for benchmarking. We further advocate for the creation of a new document classification benchmark, and provide recommendations for what characteristics such a resource should include.},

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day.},

In addition to local features, such as pixel-wise information, co-occurrence features are also useful for extracting texture-like periodic information for accurate segmentation. However, existing convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods do not have any mechanisms that explicitly extract co-occurrence features. In this paper, we propose a method for page segmentation using a CNN with trainable multiplication layers (TMLs). The TML is specialized for extracting co-occurrences from feature maps, thereby supporting the detection of objects with similar textures and periodicities. This property is also considered to be effective for document image analysis because of regularity in text line structures, tables, etc. In the experiment, we achieved promising performance on a pixel-wise page segmentation task by combining TMLs with U-Net. The results demonstrate that TMLs can improve performance compared to the original U-Net. The results also demonstrate that TMLs are helpful for detecting regions with periodically repeating features, such as tables and main text.},

Interfaces for interactive labeling tighten the loop of labeled data collection and model development, enabling a subject-matter expert to quickly establish the feasibility of a classifier to address a problem of interest. These interactive machine learning (IML) interfaces iteratively sample unlabeled data for annotation, train a new model, and display feedback on the model's estimated performance. Different sampling strategies affect both the rate at which the model improves and the bias of performance estimates. We compare the performance of three sampling strategies in the ``early-stage'' of label collection, starting from zero labeled data. By simulating a user's interactions with an IML labeling interface, we demonstrate a trade-off between improving a text classifier's performance and computing unbiased estimates of that performance. We show that supplementing early-stage sampling with user-guided text search can effectively ``seed'' a classifier with positive documents without compromising generalization performance---particularly for imbalanced tasks where positive documents are rare. We argue for the benefits of incorporating search alongside active learning in IML interfaces and identify design trade-offs around the use of non-random sampling strategies.},

Experiment results have illustrated that the self-supervised pre-trained DiT model achieves new state-of-the-art results on these downstream tasks, e.g. document image classification (91.11 \${\textbackslash}rightarrow\$ 92.69), document layout analysis (91.0 \${\textbackslash}rightarrow\$ 94.9), table detection (94.23 \${\textbackslash}rightarrow\$ 96.55) and text detection for OCR (93.07 \${\textbackslash}rightarrow\$ 94.29).

Rather than attention with a fixed number of steps for each input image, the model learns to decide when to stop on the fly. To achieve this, we add an additional continue/stop action per time step to RAM and use reinforcement learning to learn both the optimal attention policy and stopping policy. The modification is simple but could dramatically save the average computational time while keeping the same recognition performance as RAM. Experimental results on CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars dataset demonstrate the dynamic computational model can work effectively for fine-grained image recognition.The source code of this paper can be obtained from https://github.com/baidu-research/DT-RAM},

In this paper, we perform a systematic evaluation of 11 different published backbone architectures and 9 different tiling and scaling configurations for separating text, tables or table column lines. We also show the influence of the number of labels and the number of training pages on the segmentation quality, which we measure using the Matthews Correlation Coefficient. Our results show that (depending on the task) Inception-ResNet-v2 and EfficientNet backbones work best, vertical tiling is generally preferable to other tiling approaches, and training data that comprises 30 to 40 pages will be sufficient most of the time.},

Recently, this has been generalized to neural operators that learn mappings between function spaces. For partial differential equations (PDEs), neural operators directly learn the mapping from any functional parametric dependence to the solution. Thus, they learn an entire family of PDEs, in contrast to classical methods which solve one instance of the equation. In this work, we formulate a new neural operator by parameterizing the integral kernel directly in Fourier space, allowing for an expressive and efficient architecture. We perform experiments on Burgers' equation, Darcy flow, and the Navier-Stokes equation (including the turbulent regime). Our Fourier neural operator shows state-of-the-art performance compared to existing neural network methodologies and it is up to three orders of magnitude faster compared to traditional PDE solvers.},

The label map pyramid is transformed from region class label map by distance transformation and multi-level thresholding. In segmentation, the outputs of multiple tasks of LPN are summed into one single probability map, on which watershed transformation is carried out to segment the document image into instance aware regions. In experiments on four public databases, our method is demonstrated effective and superior, yielding state of the art performance for text line segmentation, baseline detection and region segmentation.},

Accurate alignment is critical for good layouts. We thus propose a novel differentiable wireframe rendering layer that maps the generated layout to a wireframe image, upon which a CNN-based discriminator is used to optimize the layouts in image space.

The model also remains moderately calibrated under distribution shift, and is sensitive to uncertainty in its own answers, rather than imitating human examples. To our knowledge, this is the first time a model has been shown to express calibrated uncertainty about its own answers in natural language. For testing calibration, we introduce the CalibratedMath suite of tasks. We compare the calibration of uncertainty expressed in words ("verbalized probability") to uncertainty extracted from model logits. Both kinds of uncertainty are capable of generalizing calibration under distribution shift. We also provide evidence that GPT-3's ability to generalize calibration depends on pre-trained latent representations that correlate with epistemic uncertainty over its answers.},

  abstract = {Few ideas have enjoyed as large an impact on deep learning as convolution. For any problem involving pixels or spatial representations, common intuition holds that convolutional neural networks may be appropriate. In this paper we show a striking counterexample to this intuition via the seemingly trivial coordinate transform problem, which simply requires learning a mapping between coordinates in (x,y) Cartesian space and one-hot pixel space. Although convolutional networks would seem appropriate for this task, we show that they fail spectacularly. We demonstrate and carefully analyze the failure first on a toy problem, at which point a simple fix becomes obvious. We call this solution CoordConv, which works by giving convolution access to its own input coordinates through the use of extra coordinate channels. Without sacrificing the computational and parametric efficiency of ordinary convolution, CoordConv allows networks to learn either complete translation invariance or varying degrees of translation dependence, as required by the end task. CoordConv solves the coordinate transform problem with perfect generalization and 150 times faster with 10--100 times fewer parameters than convolution. This stark contrast raises the question: to what extent has this inability of convolution persisted insidiously inside other tasks, subtly hampering performance from within? A complete answer to this question will require further investigation, but we show preliminary evidence that swapping convolution for CoordConv can improve models on a diverse set of tasks. Using CoordConv in a GAN produced less mode collapse as the transform between high-level spatial latents and pixels becomes easier to learn. A Faster R-CNN detection model trained on MNIST showed 24\% better IOU when using CoordConv, and in the RL domain agents playing Atari games benefit significantly from the use of CoordConv layers.},

This method is able to obtain reliable stroke correspondence and enable structural interpretation. In the model base, the reference character of each category is described in an attributed relational graph (ARG). The input character is described with feature points and line segments. The strokes and inter-stroke relations of input character are not determined until being matched with a reference character. The structural matching is accomplished in two stages: candidate stroke extraction and consistent matching. All candidate input strokes to match the reference strokes are extracted by line following and then the consistent matching is achieved by heuristic search. Some structural post- processing operations are applied to improve the stroke correspondence. Recognition experiments were implemented on an image database collected in KAIST, and promising results have been achieved. {\copyright} 2001 Pattern Recognition Society.

Uncertainty quantification (UQ) enhances trustworthiness by estimating confidence in outputs, enabling risk mitigation and selective prediction. However, traditional UQ methods struggle with LLMs due to computational constraints and decoding inconsistencies. Moreover, LLMs introduce unique uncertainty sources, such as input ambiguity, reasoning path divergence, and decoding stochasticity, that extend beyond classical aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. To address this, we introduce a new taxonomy that categorizes UQ methods based on computational efficiency and uncertainty dimensions (input, reasoning, parameter, and prediction uncertainty). We evaluate existing techniques, assess their real-world applicability, and identify open challenges, emphasizing the need for scalable, interpretable, and robust UQ approaches to enhance LLM reliability.},

This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images ofobjects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualizations produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LMs) have rapidly become a mainstay in Natural Language Processing. These models are known to acquire rich linguistic knowledge from training on large amounts of text. In this paper, we investigate if pre-training on text also confers these models with helpful 'inductive biases' for non-linguistic reasoning. On a set of 19 diverse non-linguistic tasks involving quantitative computations, recognizing regular expressions and reasoning over strings. We find that pretrained models significantly outper-form comparable non-pretrained neural models. This remains true also in experiments with training non-pretrained models with fewer parameters to account for model regularization effects. We further explore the effect of text domain on LMs by pretraining models from text from different domains and provenances. Our experiments surprisingly reveal that the positive effects of pre-training persist even when pretraining on multilingual text or computer code, and even for text generated from synthetic languages. Our findings suggest a hitherto unexplored deep connection between pre-training and inductive learning abilities of language models 1 .},

In the standard MAP decoding approach the recognizer outputs the string of words corresponding to the path with the highest posterior probability given the acoustics and a language model. However, even given optimal models, the MAP decoder does not necessarily minimize the commonly used performance metric, word error rate (WER). We describe a method for explicitly minimizing WER by extracting word hypotheses with the highest posterior probabilities from word lattices. We change the standard problem formulation by replacing global search over a large set of sentence hypotheses with local search over a small set of word candidates. In addition to improving the accuracy of the recognizer, our method produces a new representation of the set of candidate hypotheses that specifies the sequence of word-level confusions in a compact lattice format. We study the properties of confusion networks and examine their use for other tasks, such as lattice compression, word spotting, confidence annotation, and reevaluation of recognition hypotheses using higher-level knowledge sources.},

In this paper, we propose a novel Interpolated Convolution operation, InterpConv, to tackle the point cloud feature learning and understanding problem. The key idea is to utilize a set of discrete kernel weights and interpolate point features to neighboring kernel-weight coordinates by an interpolation function for convolution. A normalization term is introduced to handle neighborhoods of different sparsity levels. Our InterpConv is shown to be permutation and sparsity invariant, and can directly handle irregular inputs. We further design Interpolated Convolutional Neural Networks (InterpCNNs) based on InterpConv layers to handle point cloud recognition tasks including shape classification, object part segmentation and indoor scene semantic parsing. Experiments show that the networks can capture both fine-grained local structures and global shape context information effectively. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks including ModelNet40, ShapeNet Parts and S3DIS.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enhance medical image segmentation during test time. Instead of employing hand-crafted transforms or functions on the input test image to create multiple views for test-time augmentation, we advocate for the utilization of an advanced domain-fine-tuned generative model (GM), e.g., stable diffusion (SD), for test-time augmentation. Given that the GM has been trained to comprehend and encapsulate comprehensive domain data knowledge, it is superior than segmentation models in terms of representing the data characteristics and distribution. Hence, by integrating the GM into test-time augmentation, we can effectively generate multiple views of a given test sample, aligning with the content and appearance characteristics of the sample and the related local data distribution. This approach renders the augmentation process more adaptable and resilient compared to conventional handcrafted transforms. Comprehensive experiments conducted across three medical image segmentation tasks (nine datasets) demonstrate the efficacy and versatility of the proposed TTGA in enhancing segmentation outcomes. Moreover, TTGA significantly improves pixel-wise error estimation, thereby facilitating the deployment of a more reliable segmentation system.

In order to increase the number of samples, the use of synthetic signatures can be taken into account.

The synthesis is here faced under the perspective of supervised training: the learning model is trained to perform the task of online to offline signature conversion. The approach is based on a Deep Convolutional Neural Network. The main goal is to enlarge offline training dataset in order to improve the performance of the offline signature verification systems. For this purpose, a machine-oriented evaluation on the BiosecurID signature dataset is carried out. The use of synthetic samples (in the training phase) generated with the proposed method on a state-of-the-art classification system exhibits performance similar to those obtained using real signatures, moreover the combination of real and synthetic signature in the training set is also able to show improvements of the Equal Error Rate.}

We show that by subsampling frequent words we obtain significant speedup,  and also learn higher quality representations as measured by our tasks. We also introduce Negative Sampling, a simplified variant of Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) that learns more accurate vectors for frequent words compared to the hierarchical softmax.   An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases.  For example, the meanings of Canada'' and "Air'' cannot be easily combined to obtain "Air Canada''.  Motivated by this example, we present a simple and efficient method for finding phrases, and show that their vector representations can be accurately learned by the Skip-gram model. "},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The accurate automatic segmentation of gliomas and its intra-tumoral structures is important not only for treatment planning but also for follow-up evaluations. Several methods based on 2D and 3D Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have been developed to segment brain tumors and to classify different categories of tumors from different MRI modalities. However, these networks are often black-box models and do not provide any evidence regarding the process they take to perform this task. Increasing transparency and interpretability of such deep learning techniques is necessary for the complete integration of such methods into medical practice. In this paper, we explore various techniques to explain the functional organization of brain tumor segmentation models and to extract visualizations of internal concepts to understand how these networks achieve highly accurate tumor segmentations. We use the BraTS 2018 dataset to train three different networks with standard architectures and outline similarities and differences in the process that these networks take to segment brain tumors. We show that brain tumor segmentation networks learn certain human-understandable disentangled concepts on a filter level. We also show that they take a top-down or hierarchical approach to localizing the different parts of the tumor. We then extract visualizations of some internal feature maps and also provide a measure of uncertainty with regards to the outputs of the models to give additional qualitative evidence about the predictions of these networks. We believe that the emergence of such human-understandable organization and concepts might aid in the acceptance and integration of such methods in medical diagnosis.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

The maximum match is a number dependent upon the similarity of the sequences. One of its definitions is the largest number of amino acids of one protein that can be matched with those of a second protein allowing for all possible interruptions in either of the sequences. While the interruptions give rise to a very large number of comparisons, the method efficiently excludes from consideration those comparisons that cannot contribute to the maximum match. Comparisons are made from the smallest unit of significance, a pair of amino acids, one from each protein. All possible pairs are represented by a two-dimensional array, and all possible comparisons are represented by pathways through the array. For this maximum match only certain of the possible pathways must be evaluated. A numerical value, one in this case, is assigned to every cell in the array representing like amino acids. The maximum match is the largest number that would result from summing the cell values of every pathway.},

  abstract = {An ongoing challenge in neuromorphic computing is to devise general and computationally efficient models of inference and learning which are compatible with the spatial and temporal constraints of the brain. One increasingly popular and successful approach is to take inspiration from inference and learning algorithms used in deep neural networks. However, the workhorse of deep learning, the gradient descent Gradient Back Propagation (BP) rule, often relies on the immediate availability of network-wide information stored with high-precision memory during learning, and precise operations that are difficult to realize in neuromorphic hardware. Remarkably, recent work showed that exact backpropagated gradients are not essential for learning deep representations. Building on these results, we demonstrate an event-driven random BP (eRBP) rule that uses an error-modulated synaptic plasticity for learning deep representations. Using a two-compartment Leaky Integrate \& Fire (I\&F) neuron, the rule requires only one addition and two comparisons for each synaptic weight, making it very suitable for implementation in digital or mixed-signal neuromorphic hardware. Our results show that using eRBP, deep representations are rapidly learned, achieving classification accuracies on permutation invariant datasets comparable to those obtained in artificial neural network simulations on GPUs, while being robust to neural and synaptic state quantizations during learning.},

  abstract = {Spiking neural networks are nature's versatile solution to fault-tolerant and energy efficient signal processing. To translate these benefits into hardware, a growing number of neuromorphic spiking neural network processors attempt to emulate biological neural networks. These developments have created an imminent need for methods and tools to enable such systems to solve real-world signal processing problems. Like conventional neural networks, spiking neural networks can be trained on real, domain specific data. However, their training requires overcoming a number of challenges linked to their binary and dynamical nature. This article elucidates step-by-step the problems typically encountered when training spiking neural networks, and guides the reader through the key concepts of synaptic plasticity and data-driven learning in the spiking setting. To that end, it gives an overview of existing approaches and provides an introduction to surrogate gradient methods, specifically, as a particularly flexible and efficient method to overcome the aforementioned challenges.},

However, the blur caused by camera shake or out-of-focus problems may affect the quality of acquired images and their use as input for optical character recognition (OCR) or other types of document processing. This work proposes an end-to-end model for document deblurring using cycle-consistent adversarial networks. The main novelty of this work is to achieve blind document deblurring, i.e., deblurring without knowledge of the blur kernel. Our method, named ``Blur2Sharp CycleGAN,'' generates a sharp image from a blurry one and shows how cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks (CycleGAN) can be used in document deblurring. Using only a blurred image as input, we try to generate the sharp image. Thus, no information about the blur kernel is required. In the evaluation part, we use peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM) to compare the deblurring images. The experiments demonstrate a clear improvement in visual quality with respect to the state-of-the-art using a dataset of text images.},

This article clarifies the importance of enhancing quality of OCR results by studying their effects on information retrieval and natural language processing applications. We then define the post-OCR processing problem, illustrate its typical pipeline, and review the state-of-the-art post-OCR processing approaches.

Although automatic document classification systems can assist humans in document understanding tasks, most of of them are not designed to function with Portable Document Format (PDF), which contains text, tables or figures. In this study, we investigate separate ways to efficiently classify student documents that are uploaded in PDF format and are required for university education. We propose three possible techniques for this issue. The first approach is based on Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and traditional machine learning methods. The second is purely on deep learning. The third one is based on fusion of deep learning methods based on entropy. The proposed techniques can classify twelve distinct types of digital documents. The validity of the proposed methods has been verified by student affairs department of Kocaeli University in Turkey. The system has not only increased the efficiency of online document uploading steps for students, but also reduced the human cost for tracking the documents. The highest F-score (94.45\%) is obtained by the ensemble of EfficientNetB3 and ExtraTree.},

The success of CNNs is attributed to their ability to learn rich mid-level image representations as opposed to hand-designed low-level features used in other image classification methods. Learning CNNs, however, amounts to estimating millions of parameters and requires a very large number of annotated image samples. This property currently prevents application of CNNs to problems with limited training data. In this work we show how image representations learned with CNNs on large-scale annotated datasets can be efficiently transferred to other visual recognition tasks with limited amount of training data. We design a method to reuse layers trained on the ImageNet dataset to compute mid-level image representation for images in the PASCAL VOC dataset. We show that despite differences in image statistics and tasks in the two datasets, the transferred representation leads to significantly improved results for object and action classification, outperforming the current state of the art on Pascal VOC 2007 and 2012 datasets. We also show promising results for object and action localization.},

  abstract = {With the widespread use of mobile phones and scanners to photograph and upload documents, the need for extracting the information trapped in unstructured document images such as retail receipts, insurance claim forms and financial invoices is becoming more acute. A major hurdle to this objective is that these images often contain information in the form of tables and extracting data from tabular sub-images presents a unique set of challenges. This includes accurate detection of the tabular region within an image, and subsequently detecting and extracting information from the rows and columns of the detected table. While some progress has been made in table detection, extracting the table contents is still a challenge since this involves more fine grained table structure(rows \& columns) recognition. Prior approaches have attempted to solve the table detection and structure recognition problems independently using two separate models. In this paper, we propose TableNet: a novel end-to-end deep learning model for both table detection and structure recognition. The model exploits the interdependence between the twin tasks of table detection and table structure recognition to segment out the table and column regions. This is followed by semantic rule-based row extraction from the identified tabular sub-regions. The proposed model and extraction approach was evaluated on the publicly available ICDAR 2013 and Marmot Table datasets obtaining state of the art results. Additionally, we demonstrate that feeding additional semantic features further improves model performance and that the model exhibits transfer learning across datasets. Another contribution of this paper is to provide additional table structure annotations for the Marmot data, which currently only has annotations for table detection.},

Furthermore, we introduce a novel instruction tuning task, which facilitates the model's text-reading capability by learning to predict the relative positions of input text, eventually minimizing the risk of truncated text caused by the limited capacity of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating superior performance in various document understanding tasks.},

Although the LLMs show significantly better performance than random guessing, there is a wide variability in their tendency to change their initial answers. There is a positive correlation between qualitative confidence and accuracy, but the overall accuracy for the second answer is often worse than for the first answer. There is a strong tendency to overstate the self-reported confidence score. Confidence is only partially explained by the underlying token-level probability. The material effects of prompting on qualitative confidence and the strong tendency for overconfidence indicate that current LLMs do not have any internally coherent sense of confidence.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, cross-modal retrieval plays an important role to flexibly find useful information across different modalities of data. Effectively measuring the similarity between different modalities of data is the key of cross-modal retrieval. Different modalities, such as image and text, have imbalanced and complementary relationship, and they contain unequal amount of information when describing the same semantics. For example, images often contain more details that cannot be demonstrated by textual descriptions and vice versa. Existing works based on deep neural network mostly construct one common space for different modalities, to find the latent alignments between them, which lose their exclusive modality-specific characteristics. Therefore, we propose modality-specific cross-modal similarity measurement approach by constructing the independent semantic space for each modality, which adopts an end-to-end framework to directly generate the modality-specific cross-modal similarity without explicit common representation. For each semantic space, modality-specific characteristics within one modality are fully exploited by recurrent attention network, while the data of another modality is projected into this space with attention based joint embedding, which utilizes the learned attention weights for guiding the fine-grained cross-modal correlation learning, and captures the imbalanced and complementary relationship between different modalities. Finally, the complementarity between the semantic spaces for different modalities is explored by adaptive fusion of the modality-specific cross-modal similarities to perform the cross-modal retrieval. Experiments on the widely used Wikipedia, Pascal Sentence, and MS-COCO data sets as well as our constructed large-scale XMediaNet data set verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach, outperforming nine state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {Accurate and reliable wind speed forecasting is vital in power system scheduling and management. Ensemble techniques are widely employed to enhance wind speed forecasting accuracy. This paper proposes a negative correlation learning-based regularized extreme learning machine ensemble model (NCL-RELM) integrated with optimal variational mode decomposition (OVMD) and sample entropy (SampEn) for multi-step ahead wind speed forecasting. For this purpose, the original wind speed time series is firstly decomposed into a few variational modes and a residue using OVMD, and then the decomposed subseries with approximate SampEn values are aggregated into a new subseries to reduce the computational burden. Secondly, a NCL-RELM ensemble model is employed to model each aggregated subseries. The NCL technique is employed to enhance the diversity among multiple sub-RELM models such that the predictability of a single RELM model can be enhanced. Finally, the prediction results of all subseries are added up to obtain an aggregated result for the original wind speed. The simulation results indicate that: (1) the NCL-RELM model performs better than other ensemble approaches including BAGTREE, BOOST and random forest; (2) the proposed OS-NCL-RELM model obtains the best statistical metrics from 1- to 3-step ahead forecasting compared with the other nine benchmark models.},

  abstract = {Large Language Models (LLM) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP), improving state-of-the-art on many existing tasks and exhibiting emergent capabilities. However, LLMs have not yet been successfully applied on semi-structured document information extraction, which is at the core of many document processing workflows and consists of extracting key entities from a visually rich document (VRD) given a predefined target schema. The main obstacles to LLM adoption in that task have been the absence of layout encoding within LLMs, critical for a high quality extraction, and the lack of a grounding mechanism ensuring the answer is not hallucinated. In this paper, we introduce Language Model-based Document Information Extraction and Localization (LMDX), a methodology to adapt arbitrary LLMs for document information extraction. LMDX can do extraction of singular, repeated, and hierarchical entities, both with and without training data, while providing grounding guarantees and localizing the entities within the document. In particular, we apply LMDX to the PaLM 2-S LLM and evaluate it on VRDU and CORD benchmarks, setting a new state-of-the-art and showing how LMDX enables the creation of high quality, data-efficient parsers.},

  abstract = {Learning from demonstrations is a paradigm by which an apprentice agent learns a control policy for a dynamic environment by observing demonstrations delivered by an expert agent. It is usually implemented as either imitation learning (IL) or inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) in the literature. On the one hand, IRL is a paradigm relying on the Markov decision processes, where the goal of the apprentice agent is to find a reward function from the expert demonstrations that could explain the expert behavior. On the other hand, IL consists in directly generalizing the expert strategy, observed in the demonstrations, to unvisited states (and it is therefore close to classification, when there is a finite set of possible decisions). While these two visions are often considered as opposite to each other, the purpose of this paper is to exhibit a formal link between these approaches from which new algorithms can be derived. We show that IL and IRL can be redefined in a way that they are equivalent, in the sense that there exists an explicit bijective operator (namely, the inverse optimal Bellman operator) between their respective spaces of solutions. To do so, we introduce the set-policy framework that creates a clear link between the IL and the IRL. As a result, the IL and IRL solutions making the best of both worlds are obtained. In addition, it is a unifying framework from which existing IL and IRL algorithms can be derived and which opens the way for the IL methods able to deal with the environment's dynamics. Finally, the IRL algorithms derived from the set-policy framework are compared with the algorithms belonging to the more common trajectory-matching family. Experiments demonstrate that the set-policy-based algorithms outperform both the standard IRL and IL ones and result in more robust solutions.},

The approach does not exploit any thinning or skeletonization procedure, but rather a different type of information is manipulated concerning the curvature function of the word contour. In this way, it is possible to detect the parts of the image where the original odometric information is lost or ambiguous (such as, for example, at an intersection of the handwritten lines) and interpret them to finally recover a part of the original temporal information. The algorithm scans the word, following the natural course of the line, and attempts to reproduce the same movement as executed by the writer during the generation of the word. It segments the cursive trace where the contour shows the slow-down of the original movement (corresponding to the maximum curvature points of the curve). At the end of the scanning process, a temporal sequence of motor strokes is obtained which plausibly composed the original intended movement.},

  abstract = {The Fourier domain is used in computer vision and machine learning as image analysis tasks in the Fourier domain are analogous to spatial domain methods but are achieved using different operations. Convolutional Neu-ral Networks (CNNs) use machine learning to achieve state-of-the-art results with respect to many computer vision tasks. One of the main limiting aspects of CNNs is the computational cost of updating a large number of convolution parameters. Further, in the spatial domain, larger images take exponentially longer than smaller image to train on CNNs due to the operations involved in convolu-tion methods. Consequently, CNNs are often not a viable solution for large image computer vision tasks. In this paper a Fourier Convolution Neural Network (FCNN) is proposed whereby training is conducted entirely within the Fourier domain. The advantage offered is that there is a significant speed up in training time without loss of effectiveness. Using the proposed approach larger images can therefore be processed within viable computation time. The FCNN is fully described and evaluated. The evaluation was conducted using the benchmark Ci-far10 and MNIST datasets, and a bespoke fundus retina image dataset. The results demonstrate that convolution in the Fourier domain gives a significant speed up without adversely affecting accuracy. For simplicity the proposed FCNN concept is presented in the context of a basic CNN architecture, however, the FCNN concept has the potential to improve the speed of any neural network system involving convolution.},

Although many deep learning-based classification algorithms are studied for handwritten digits recognition, the recognition accuracy and running time still need to be further improved. In this paper, an adaptive deep Q-learning strategy is proposed to improve accuracy and shorten running time for handwritten digit recognition. The adaptive deep Q-learning strategy combines the feature-extracting capability of deep learning and the decision-making of reinforcement learning to form an adaptive Q-learning deep belief network (Q-ADBN). First, Q-ADBN extracts the features of original images using an adaptive deep auto-encoder (ADAE), and the extracted features are considered as the current states of Q-learning algorithm. Second, Q-ADBN receives Q-function (reward signal) during recognition of the current states, and the final handwritten digits recognition is implemented by maximizing the Q-function using Q-learning algorithm. Finally, experimental results from the well-known MNIST dataset show that the proposed Q-ADBN has a superiority to other similar methods in terms of accuracy and running time.},

In this paper, a 3-phase approach to restore a writing order is proposed within the framework of the Edge Continuity Relation (ECR). In the initial, local phase, in order to obtain possible ECRs at an even-degree node, a neural network is used for the node of degree 4 and a theoretical approach is presented for the node of degree higher than 4 by introducing certain reasonable assumptions. In the second phase, we identify double-traced lines by employing maximum weighted matching. This makes it possible to transform the problem of obtaining possible ECRs at odd-degree node to that at even-degree node. In the final, global phase, we find all the candidates of single-stroked paths by depth first search and select the best one by evaluating SLALOM smoothness. Experiments on static images converted from online data in the Unipen database show that our method achieves a restoration rate of 96.0 percent. {\copyright} 2006 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Conventional Vision Transformer simplifies visual modeling by standardizing input resolutions, often disregarding the variability of natural visual data and compromising spatial-contextual fidelity. While preliminary explorations have superficially investigated native resolution modeling, existing approaches still lack systematic analysis from a visual representation perspective. To bridge this gap, we introduce UniViTAR, a family of homogeneous vision foundation models tailored for unified visual modality and native resolution scenario in the era of multimodal. Our framework first conducts architectural upgrades to the vanilla paradigm by integrating multiple advanced components. Building upon these improvements, a progressive training paradigm is introduced, which strategically combines two core mechanisms: (1) resolution curriculum learning, transitioning from fixed-resolution pretraining to native resolution tuning, thereby leveraging ViT's inherent adaptability to variable-length sequences, and (2) visual modality adaptation via inter-batch image-video switching, which balances computational efficiency with enhanced temporal reasoning. In parallel, a hybrid training framework further synergizes sigmoid-based contrastive loss with feature distillation from a frozen teacher model, thereby accelerating early-stage convergence. Finally, trained exclusively on public datasets, externsive experiments across multiple model scales from 0.3B to 1B demonstrate its effectiveness.},

  abstract = {State-of-the-art computer vision systems are trained to predict a fixed set of predetermined object categories. This restricted form of supervision limits their generality and usability since additional labeled data is needed to specify any other visual concept. Learning directly from raw text about images is a promising alternative which leverages a much broader source of supervision. We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of predicting which caption goes with which image is an efficient and scalable way to learn SOTA image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural language is used to reference learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling zero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We study the performance of this approach by benchmarking on over 30 different existing computer vision datasets, spanning tasks such as OCR, action recognition in videos, geo-localization, and many types of fine-grained object classification. The model transfers non-trivially to most tasks and is often competitive with a fully supervised baseline without the need for any dataset specific training. For instance, we match the accuracy of the original ResNet-50 on ImageNet zero-shot without needing to use any of the 1.28 million training examples it was trained on.},

In this work we present properties of neural networks that complement this aspect of expressivity. By using tools from Fourier analysis, we highlight a learning bias of deep networks towards low frequency functions-i.e. functions that vary globally without local fluctuations-which manifests itself as a frequency-dependent learning speed. Intuitively, this property is in line with the observation that over-parameterized networks prioritize learning simple patterns that generalize across data samples. We also investigate the role of the shape of the data manifold by presenting empirical and theoretical evidence that, somewhat counter-intuitively, learning higher frequencies gets easier with increasing manifold complexity.},

The strategy with the best performance involves splitting the input document in character n-grams and combining their individual corrections into the final output using a voting scheme that is equivalent to an ensemble of a large number of sequence models. We further investigate how to weigh the contributions from each one of the members of this ensemble.

  abstract = {We introduce a modern Hopfield network with continuous states and a corresponding update rule. The new Hopfield network can store exponentially (with the dimension of the associative space) many patterns, retrieves the pattern with one update, and has exponentially small retrieval errors. It has three types of energy minima (fixed points of the update): (1) global fixed point averaging over all patterns, (2) metastable states averaging over a subset of patterns, and (3) fixed points which store a single pattern. The new update rule is equivalent to the attention mechanism used in transformers. This equivalence enables a characterization of the heads of transformer models. These heads perform in the first layers preferably global averaging and in higher layers partial averaging via metastable states. The new modern Hopfield network can be integrated into deep learning architectures as layers to allow the storage of and access to raw input data, intermediate results, or learned prototypes. These Hopfield layers enable new ways of deep learning, beyond fully-connected, convolutional, or recurrent networks, and provide pooling, memory, association, and attention mechanisms. We demonstrate the broad applicability of the Hopfield layers across various domains. Hopfield layers improved state-of-the-art on three out of four considered multiple instance learning problems as well as on immune repertoire classification with several hundreds of thousands of instances. On the UCI benchmark collections of small classification tasks, where deep learning methods typically struggle, Hopfield layers yielded a new state-of-the-art when compared to different machine learning methods. Finally, Hopfield layers achieved state-of-the-art on two drug design datasets. The implementation is available at: https://github.com/ml-jku/hopfield-layers},

However, adding HTR capability to a large scale multilingual OCR system poses new challenges. This paper addresses three problems in building such systems: data, efficiency, and integration. Firstly, one of the biggest challenges is obtaining sufficient amounts of high quality training data. We address the problem by using online handwriting data collected for a large scale production online handwriting recognition system. We describe our image data generation pipeline and study how online data can be used to build HTR models. We show that the data improve the models significantly under the condition where only a small number of real images is available, which is usually the case for HTR models. It enables us to support a new script at substantially lower cost. Secondly, we propose a line recognition model based on neural networks without recurrent connections. The model achieves a comparable accuracy with LSTM-based models while allowing for better parallelism in training and inference. Finally, we present a simple way to integrate HTR models into an OCR system. These constitute a solution to bring HTR capability into a large scale OCR system.},

  abstract = {Active learning (AL) attempts to maximize a model's performance gain while annotating the fewest samples possible. Deep learning (DL) is greedy for data and requires a large amount of data supply to optimize a massive number of parameters if the model is to learn how to extract high-quality features. In recent years, due to the rapid development of internet technology, we have entered an era of information abundance characterized by massive amounts of available data. As a result, DL has attracted significant attention from researchers and has been rapidly developed. Compared with DL, however, researchers have a relatively low interest in AL. This is mainly because before the rise of DL, traditional machine learning requires relatively few labeled samples, meaning that early AL is rarely according the value it deserves. Although DL has made breakthroughs in various fields, most of this success is due to a large number of publicly available annotated datasets. However, the acquisition of a large number of high-quality annotated datasets consumes a lot of manpower, making it unfeasible in fields that require high levels of expertise (such as speech recognition, information extraction, medical images, etc.). Therefore, AL is gradually coming to receive the attention it is due. It is therefore natural to investigate whether AL can be used to reduce the cost of sample annotation while retaining the powerful learning capabilities of DL. As a result of such investigations, deep active learning (DeepAL) has emerged. Although research on this topic is quite abundant, there has not yet been a comprehensive survey of DeepAL-related works; accordingly, this article aims to fill this gap. We provide a formal classification method for the existing work, along with a comprehensive and systematic overview. In addition, we also analyze and summarize the development of DeepAL from an application perspective. Finally, we discuss the confusion and problems associated with DeepAL and provide some possible development directions.},

(2) Performing cross fold training on a single set of ground truth data (line images and their transcriptions) with a single OCR engine (OCRopus) produces a committee whose members then vote for the best outcome by also taking the top-N alternatives and their intrinsic confidence values into account. (3) Following the principle of maximal disagreement we select additional training lines which the voters disagree most on, expecting them to offer the highest information gain for a subsequent training (active learning). Evaluations on six early printed books yielded the following results: On average the combination of pretraining and voting improved the character accuracy by 46\% when training five folds starting from the same mixed model. This number rose to 53\% when using different models for pretraining, underlining the importance of diverse voters. Incorporating active learning improved the obtained results by another 16\% on average (evaluated on three of the six books). Overall, the proposed methods lead to an average error rate of 2.5\% when training on only 60 lines. Using a substantial ground truth pool of 1,000 lines brought the error rate down even further to less than 1\% on average.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach towards Indic handwritten word recognition using zone-wise information. Because of complex nature due to compound characters, modifiers, overlapping and touching, etc., character segmentation and recognition is a tedious job in Indic scripts (e.g. Devanagari, Bangla, Gurumukhi, and other similar scripts). To avoid character segmentation in such scripts, HMM-based sequence modeling has been used earlier in holistic way. This paper proposes an efficient word recognition framework by segmenting the handwritten word images horizontally into three zones (upper, middle and lower) and recognize the corresponding zones. The main aim of this zone segmentation approach is to reduce the number of distinct component classes compared to the total number of classes in Indic scripts. As a result, use of this zone segmentation approach enhances the recognition performance of the system. The components in middle zone where characters are mostly touching are recognized using HMM. After the recognition of middle zone, HMM based Viterbi forced alignment is applied to mark the left and right boundaries of the characters. Next, the residue components, if any, in upper and lower zones in their respective boundary are combined to achieve the final word level recognition. Water reservoir feature has been integrated in this framework to improve the zone segmentation and character alignment defects while segmentation. A novel sliding window-based feature, called Pyramid Histogram of Oriented Gradient (PHOG) is proposed for middle zone recognition. An exhaustive experiment is performed on two Indic scripts namely, Bangla and Devanagari for the performance evaluation. From the experiment, it has been noted that proposed zone-wise recognition improves accuracy with respect to the traditional way of Indic word recognition.},

In this paper we show that they learn an implicit LM and attempt to characterize the strength of the LM in terms of equivalent n-gram context. We show that this implicitly learned language model provides a 2.4{\textbackslash}\% CER improvement on our synthetic test set when compared against a test set of random characters (i.e. not naturally occurring sequences), and that the LSTM learns to use up to 5 characters of context (which is roughly 88 frames in our configuration). We believe that this is the first ever attempt at characterizing the strength of the implicit LM in LSTM based OCR systems.},

  abstract = {Deep learning has seen remarkable developments over the last years, many of them inspired by neuroscience. However, the main learning mechanism behind these advances-error backpropagation-appears to be at odds with neurobiology. Here, we introduce a multilayer neuronal network model with simplified dendritic compartments in which error-driven synaptic plasticity adapts the network towards a global desired output. In contrast to previous work our model does not require separate phases and synaptic learning is driven by local dendritic prediction errors continuously in time. Such errors originate at apical dendrites and occur due to a mismatch between predictive input from lateral interneurons and activity from actual top-down feedback. Through the use of simple dendritic compartments and different cell-types our model can represent both error and normal activity within a pyramidal neuron. We demonstrate the learning capabilities of the model in regression and classification tasks, and show analytically that it approximates the error backpropagation algorithm. Moreover, our framework is consistent with recent observations of learning between brain areas and the architecture of cortical microcircuits. Overall, we introduce a novel view of learning on dendritic cortical circuits and on how the brain may solve the long-standing synaptic credit assignment problem.},

However, the existing datasets are limited in size and diversity. This work proposes LS-HDIB - a large-scale handwritten document image binarization dataset containing over a million document images that span numerous real-world scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a novel technique that uses a combination of adaptive thresholding and seamless cloning methods to create the dataset with accurate ground truths. Through an extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation over eight different deep learning based models, we demonstrate the enhancement in the performance of these models when trained on the LS-HDIB dataset and tested on unseen images.},

  abstract = {Deep learning (DL) has revolutionized the field of document image analysis, showcasing superhuman performance across a diverse set of tasks. However, the inherent black-box nature of deep learning models still presents a significant challenge to their safe and robust deployment in industry. Regrettably, while a plethora of research has been dedicated in recent years to the development of DL-powered document analysis systems, research addressing their transparency aspects has been relatively scarce. In this paper, we aim to bridge this research gap by introducing DocXplain, a novel model-agnostic explainability method specifically designed for generating high interpretability feature attribution maps for the task of document image classification. In particular, our approach involves independently segmenting the foreground and background features of the documents into different document elements and then ablating these elements to assign feature importance. We extensively evaluate our proposed approach in the context of document image classification, utilizing 4 different evaluation metrics, 2 widely recognized document benchmark datasets, and 10 state-of-the-art document image classification models. By conducting a thorough quantitative and qualitative analysis against 9 existing state-of-the-art attribution methods, we demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of both faithfulness and interpretability. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this work presents the first model-agnostic attribution-based explainability method specifically tailored for document images. We anticipate that our work will significantly contribute to advancing research on transparency, fairness, and robustness of document image classification models.},

First, a general principle of time-normalization is given using time-warping function. Then, two time-normalized distance definitions, called symmetric and asymmetric forms, are derived from the principle. These two forms are compared with each other through theoretical discussions and experimental studies. The symmetric form algorithm superiority is established. A new technique, called slope constraint, is successfully introduced, in which the warping function slope is restricted so as to improve discrimination between words in different categories. The effective slope constraint characteristic is qualitatively analyzed, and the optimum slope constraint condition is determined through experiments. The optimized algorithm is then extensively subjected to experimental comparison with various DP-algorithms, previously applied to spoken word recognition by different research groups. The experiment shows that the present algorithm gives no more than about two-thirds errors, even compared to the best conventional algorithm. {\copyright} 1978 IEEE},

Existing methods aimed at reducing hallucinations through inference time intervention incur a significant increase in latency. To mitigate this, we present SPIN, a task-agnostic attention-guided head suppression strategy that can be seamlessly integrated during inference, without incurring any significant compute or latency overhead. We investigate whether hallucination in LVLMs can be linked to specific model components. Our analysis suggests that hallucinations can be attributed to a dynamic subset of attention heads in each layer. Leveraging this insight, for each text query token, we selectively suppress attention heads that exhibit low attention to image tokens, keeping the top-K attention heads intact. Extensive evaluations on visual question answering and image description tasks demonstrate the efficacy of SPIN in reducing hallucination scores up to 2.7x while maintaining F1, and improving throughput by 1.8x compared to existing alternatives.

Inspired by previous work on fast weights, we propose to replace the update rule with an alternative rule yielding such behaviour.

Structure and training procedure of the proposed network are explained. In regression and classification experiments on artificial data, the proposed structure gives better results than other approaches. For real data, classification experiments for phonemes from the TIMIT database show the same tendency. In the second part of this paper, it is shown how the proposed bidirectional structure can be easily modified to allow efficient estimation of the conditional posterior probability of complete symbol sequences without making any explicit assumption about the shape of the distribution.

However, this approach is rather restrictive in practice since collecting a large set of labeled images is very expensive. One way to ease this problem is coming up with smart ways for choosing images to be labelled from a very large collection (i.e. active learning). Our empirical study suggests that many of the active learning heuristics in the literature are not effective when applied to CNNs when applied in batch setting. Inspired by these limitations, we define the problem of active learning as core-set selection, i.e. choosing set of points such that a model learned over the selected subset is competitive for the remaining data points. We further present a theoretical result characterizing the performance of any selected subset using the geometry of the datapoints. As an active learning algorithm, we choose the subset which is expected to yield best result according to our characterization. Our experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in image classification experiments by a large margin.},

While active learning is sample-efficient, it can be computationally expensive since it requires iterative retraining. To speed this up, we introduce a lightweight architecture for NER, viz., the CNN-CNN-LSTM model consisting of convolutional character and word encoders and a long short term memory (LSTM) tag decoder. The model achieves nearly state-of-the-art performance on standard datasets for the task while being computationally much more efficient than best performing models.

We present existing methods within a relevant taxonomy, unifying ostensibly disparate methods to aid understanding of the state of the art.

We show that this enables generation of highly realistic images, which we demonstrate both qualitatively and with a user study.

We make several key modifications to the standard GAN algorithm to preserve annotations, avoid artifacts, and stabilize training: (i) a 'self-regularization' term, (ii) a local adversarial loss, and (iii) updating the discriminator using a history of refined images. We show that this enables generation of highly realistic images, which we demonstrate both qualitatively and with a user study. We quantitatively evaluate the generated images by training models for gaze estimation and hand pose estimation. We show a significant improvement over using synthetic images, and achieve state-of-the-art results on the MPIIGaze dataset without any labeled real data.},

We analyze the efficacy of semantic segmentation networks for this purpose and simplify the problem by proposing prediction tiling based on the consistency assumption which holds for tabular structures. For an image of dimensions H {\texttimes} W, we predict a single column for the rows ({\^y}row {$\epsilon$} H) and a predict a single row for the columns ({\^y}row {$\epsilon$} W). We use a dual-headed architecture where initial feature maps (from the encoder-decoder model) are shared while the last two layers generate class specific (row/column) predictions. This allows us to generate predictions using a single model for both rows and columns simultaneously, where previous methods relied on two separate models for inference. With the proposed method, we were able to achieve state-of-the-art results on ICDAR-13 image-based table structure recognition dataset with an average F-Measure of 92.39\% (91.90\% and 92.88\% F-Measure for rows and columns respectively). With the proposed method, we were able to achieve state-of-the-art results on ICDAR-13. The obtained results advocate that constraining the problem space in the case of FCN by imposing valid constraints can lead to significant performance gains.},

  abstract = {Supervised learning, despite being extremely effective, relies on expensive, time-consuming, and error-prone annotations. Self-supervised learning has recently emerged as a strong alternate to supervised learning in a range of different domains as collecting a large amount of unlabeled data can be achieved by simply crawling the internet. These self-supervised methods automatically discover features relevant to represent an input example by using self-defined proxy tasks. In this paper, we question the potential of commonly employed purely supervised training (starting either from ImageNet pretrained networks or pure random initialization) in contrast to self-supervised representations that can be learned directly using self-supervised representation learning methods on large document image datasets. For this purpose, we leverage a large-scale document image collection (RVL-CDIP) to train ResNet-50 image encoder using two different self-supervision methods (SimCLR and Barlow Twins). Employing a linear classifier on top of self-supervised embeddings from ResNet-50 results in an accuracy of 86.75\% as compared to 71.43\% from the corresponding ImageNet pretrained embeddings. Similarly, evaluating on Tobacco-3482 dataset using self-supervised embeddings from ResNet-50 yields an accuracy of 88.52\% in contrast to 74.16\% from the corresponding ImageNet pretrained embeddings. We show that in the case of limited labeled data, this wide gap in performance between self-supervised and fully supervised models persists even after fine-tuning pretrained models. However, a significant reduction in this gap is observed with an increasing amount of data including the case where the model is trained from scratch. Our results show that representations learned using self-supervised representation learning techniques are a viable option for document image classification, specifically in the context of limited labeled data, which is a usual restriction in industrial use cases.},

Further, it can also be trained to generate auxiliary markup related to formatting, layout and content. We use character level vocabulary, thereby enabling language and terminology of any subject. The model achieves a new state-of-art in paragraph level recognition on the IAM dataset.

Supervised deep learning methods for image enhancement can generate high-quality enhanced images. However, these methods demand the availability of corresponding clean images or ground truth text. Sometimes this requirement is difficult to fulfill for real-world noisy documents. For instance, it can be challenging to create paired noisy/clean training datasets or obtain ground truth text for noisy point-of-sale receipts and invoices. Unsu-pervised methods have been explored in recent years to enhance images in the absence of ground truth images or text. However, these methods focus on enhancing natural scene images. In the case of document images, preserving the readability of text in the enhanced images is of utmost importance for improved OCR performance. In this work, we propose a modified architecture to the CycleGAN model to improve its performance in enhancing document images with better text preservation. Inspired by the success of CNN-BiLSTM combination networks in text recognition models, we propose modifying the discriminator network in the CycleGAN model to a combined CNN-BiLSTM network for better feature extraction from document images during classification by the discriminator network. Results indicate that our proposed model not only leads to better preservation of text and improved OCR performance over the CycleGAN model but also achieves better performance than the classical unsupervised image pre-processing techniques like Sauvola and Otsu.},

However, the current work on zero-shot learning in document image classification remains scarce. The existing studies either focus exclusively on zero-shot inference, or their evaluation does not align with the established criteria of zero-shot evaluation in the visual recognition domain. We provide a comprehensive document image classification analysis in Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) and Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) settings to address this gap. Our methodology and evaluation align with the established practices of this domain. Additionally, we propose zero-shot splits for the RVL-CDIP dataset. Furthermore, we introduce CICA~(pronounced ``ki\$\${\textbackslash}cdot \$\${$\cdot$}ka''), a framework that enhances the zero-shot learning capabilities of CLIP. CICA~consists of a novel `content module' designed to leverage any generic document-related textual information. The discriminative features extracted by this module are aligned with CLIP's text and image features using a novel `coupled-contrastive' loss. Our module improves CLIP's ZSL top-1 accuracy by 6.7\% and GZSL harmonic mean by 24\% on the RVL-CDIP dataset. Our module is lightweight and adds only 3.3\% more parameters to CLIP. Our work sets the direction for future research in zero-shot document classification.},

Due to their large parameter space, they require many labeled samples when trained in a supervised setting. The costs of annotating data manually can render the use of DCNNs infeasible. We present a novel framework called RenderGAN that can generate large amounts of realistic, labeled images by combining a 3D model and the Generative Adversarial Network framework. In our approach, image augmentations (e.g. lighting, background, and detail) are learned from unlabeled data such that the generated images are strikingly realistic while preserving the labels known from the 3D model. We apply the RenderGAN framework to generate images of barcode-like markers that are attached to honeybees. Training a DCNN on data generated by the RenderGAN yields considerably better performance than training it on various baselines.},

  abstract = {Ad blocker proliferation threatens the revenue streams of many websites and raises fears about the viability of digital advertising as a whole. Although industry initiatives have increasingly aimed to mitigate ad blocking, surprisingly little research addresses the problem. It remains largely unknown which factors drive ad blocking or help unblocking or ``whitelisting'' of select websites. This article presents an exploratory survey study of 1,634 ad blocker users and uncovers the main factors driving ad blocking and conditions for unblocking select websites. The conditions suggest changes to online advertising in line with current industry initiatives, as well as opportunities for direct appeals to ad blocker users. A field experiment with 294,331 users tests whether banner appeals can reduce ad blocking. The results show that these appeals reduce ad blocking among 1\% of the ad blocker users, and among frequent visitors who encounter repeated banner appeals, this percentage increases to 2\%. However, repeated banners also lead to fewer website visits of users not conforming to the appeal, which suggests a trade-off between reducing ad blocking among some users and further increasing avoidance behaviors among others.},

We demonstrate that, in different tasks (document clean up, binarization, deblurring and watermark removal), DE-GAN can produce an enhanced version of the degraded document with a high quality. In addition, our approach provides consistent improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods over the widely used DIBCO 2013, DIBCO 2017, and H-DIBCO 2018 datasets, proving its ability to restore a degraded document image to its ideal condition.

  abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have produced excellent results in natural scene semantic pixel labeling tasks. We examine the application of this idea to document processing, using fully supervised Deep CNN semantic segmentation to separate content layers from historical document images containing diverse content types, including handwriting, machine print, form lines, and stamps. For efficiency, we employ a downsampling-upsampling network to make dense pixel predictions. CNNs achieve high generalization accuracy on document images with interleaved, overlapping strokes, even when trained on a solitary pixel-labeled document image. We also show a proof-of-concept extension of the semantic segmentation task to handwritten cursive character recognition, enabling a new "segmentation-free" approach to handwriting transcription.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes the use of a new neural network architecture that combines a deep convolutional neural network with an encoder--decoder, called sequence to sequence, to solve the problem of recognizing isolated handwritten words. The proposed architecture aims to identify the characters and contextualize them with their neighbors to recognize any given word. Our model proposes a novel way to extract relevant visual features from a word image. It combines the use of a horizontal sliding window, to extract image patches, and the application of the LeNet-5 convolutional architecture to identify the characters. Extracted features are modeled using a sequence-to-sequence architecture to encode the visual characteristics and then to decode the sequence of characters in the handwritten text image. We test the proposed model on two handwritten databases (IAM and RIMES) under several experiments to determine the optimal parameterization of the model. Competitive results above those presented in the current state-of-the-art, on handwriting models, are achieved. Without using any language model and with closed dictionary, we obtain a word error rate in the test set of 12.7\% in IAM and 6.6\% in RIMES.},

  abstract = {This research attempts to construct a network that can convert online and offline handwritten characters to each other. The proposed network consists of two Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) with a shared latent space. The VAEs are trained to generate online and offline handwritten Latin characters simultaneously. In this way, we create a cross-modal VAE (Cross-VAE). During training, the proposed Cross-VAE is trained to minimize the reconstruction loss of the two modalities, the distribution loss of the two VAEs, and a novel third loss called the space sharing loss. This third, space sharing loss is used to encourage the modalities to share the same latent space by calculating the distance between the latent variables. Through the proposed method mutual conversion of online and offline handwritten characters is possible. In this paper, we demonstrate the performance of the Cross-VAE through qualitative and quantitative analysis.},

  abstract = {Human vision is able to capture the part-whole hierarchical information from the entire scene. This paper presents the Visual Parser (ViP) that explicitly constructs such a hierarchy with transformers. ViP divides visual representations into two levels, the part level and the whole level. Information of each part represents a combination of several independent vectors within the whole. To model the representations of the two levels, we first encode the information from the whole into part vectors through an attention mechanism, then decode the global information within the part vectors back into the whole representation. By iteratively parsing the two levels with the proposed encoder-decoder interaction, the model can gradually refine the features on both levels. Experimental results demonstrate that ViP can achieve very competitive performance on three major tasks e.g. classification, detection and instance segmentation. In particular, it can surpass the previous state-of-the-art CNN backbones by a large margin on object detection. The tiny model of the ViP family with \$7.2{\textbackslash}times\$ fewer parameters and \$10.9{\textbackslash}times\$ fewer FLOPS can perform comparably with the largest model ResNeXt-101-64\${\textbackslash}times\$4d of ResNe(X)t family. Visualization results also demonstrate that the learnt parts are highly informative of the predicting class, making ViP more explainable than previous fundamental architectures. Code is available at https://github.com/kevin-ssy/ViP.},

These results shed light on recent advances in computer vision and graphics that achieve state-of-the-art results by using MLPs to represent complex 3D objects and scenes. Using tools from the neural tangent kernel (NTK) literature, we show that a standard MLP fails to learn high frequencies both in theory and in practice. To overcome this spectral bias, we use a Fourier feature mapping to transform the effective NTK into a stationary kernel with a tunable bandwidth. We suggest an approach for selecting problem-specific Fourier features that greatly improves the performance of MLPs for low-dimensional regression tasks relevant to the computer vision and graphics communities.},

  abstract = {Recent work has shown that by approximating the behaviour of a non-differentiable black-box function using a neural network, the black-box can be integrated into a differentiable training pipeline for end-to-end training. This methodology is termed "differentiable bypass,'' and a successful application of this method involves training a document preprocessor to improve the performance of a black-box OCR engine. However, a good approximation of an OCR engine requires querying it for all samples throughout the training process, which can be computationally and financially expensive. Several zeroth-order optimization (ZO) algorithms have been proposed in black-box attack literature to find adversarial examples for a black-box model by computing its gradient in a query-efficient manner. However, the query complexity and convergence rate of such algorithms makes them infeasible for our problem. In this work, we propose two sample selection algorithms to train an OCR preprocessor with less than 10\% of the original system's OCR engine queries, resulting in more than 60\% reduction of the total training time without significant loss of accuracy. We also show an improvement of 4\% in the word-level accuracy of a commercial OCR engine with only 2.5\% of the total queries and a 32x reduction in monetary cost. Further, we propose a simple ranking technique to prune 30\% of the document images from the training dataset without affecting the system's performance.},

  abstract = {This report introduces a new family of multimodal models, Gemini, that exhibit remarkable capabilities across image, audio, video, and text understanding. The Gemini family consists of Ultra, Pro, and Nano sizes, suitable for applications ranging from complex reasoning tasks to on-device memory-constrained use-cases. Evaluation on a broad range of benchmarks shows that our most-capable Gemini Ultra model advances the state of the art in 30 of 32 of these benchmarks - notably being the first model to achieve human-expert performance on the well-studied exam benchmark MMLU, and improving the state of the art in every one of the 20 multimodal benchmarks we examined. We believe that the new capabilities of the Gemini family in cross-modal reasoning and language understanding will enable a wide variety of use cases. We discuss our approach toward post-training and deploying Gemini models responsibly to users through services including Gemini, Gemini Advanced, Google AI Studio, and Cloud Vertex AI.},

We formulate binarization as a pixel classification learning task and apply a novel Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) architecture that operates at multiple image scales, including full resolution. The FCN is trained to optimize a continuous version of the Pseudo F-measure metric and an ensemble of FCNs outperform the competition winners on 4 of 7 DIBCO competitions. This same binarization technique can also be applied to different domains such as Palm Leaf Manuscripts with good performance. We analyze the performance of the proposed model w.r.t. the architectural hyperparameters, size and diversity of training data, and the input features chosen.},

  abstract = {Recently, neural networks purely based on attention were shown to address image understanding tasks such as image classification. However, these visual transformers are pre-trained with hundreds of millions of images using an expensive infrastructure, thereby limiting their adoption. In this work, we produce a competitive convolution-free transformer by training on Imagenet only. We train them on a single computer in less than 3 days. Our reference vision transformer (86M parameters) achieves top-1 accuracy of 83.1\% (single-crop evaluation) on ImageNet with no external data. More importantly, we introduce a teacher-student strategy specific to transformers. It relies on a distillation token ensuring that the student learns from the teacher through attention. We show the interest of this token-based distillation, especially when using a convnet as a teacher. This leads us to report results competitive with convnets for both Imagenet (where we obtain up to 85.2\% accuracy) and when transferring to other tasks. We share our code and models.},

  abstract = {Although convolutional networks have been the dominant architecture for vision tasks for many years, recent experiments have shown that Transformer-based models, most notably the Vision Transformer (ViT), may exceed their performance in some settings. However, due to the quadratic runtime of the self-attention layers in Transformers, ViTs require the use of patch embeddings, which group together small regions of the image into single input features, in order to be applied to larger image sizes. This raises a question: Is the performance of ViTs due to the inherently-more-powerful Transformer architecture, or is it at least partly due to using patches as the input representation? In this paper, we present some evidence for the latter: specifically, we propose the ConvMixer, an extremely simple model that is similar in spirit to the ViT and the even-more-basic MLP-Mixer in that it operates directly on patches as input, separates the mixing of spatial and channel dimensions, and maintains equal size and resolution throughout the network. In contrast, however, the ConvMixer uses only standard convolutions to achieve the mixing steps. Despite its simplicity, we show that the ConvMixer outperforms the ViT, MLP-Mixer, and some of their variants for similar parameter counts and data set sizes, in addition to outperforming classical vision models such as the ResNet.

  abstract = {Neural network weights are typically initialized at random from univariate distributions, controlling just the variance of individual weights even in highly-structured operations like convolutions. Recent ViT-inspired convolutional networks such as ConvMixer and ConvNeXt use large-kernel depthwise convolutions whose learned filters have notable structure; this presents an opportunity to study their empirical covariances. In this work, we first observe that such learned filters have highly-structured covariance matrices, and moreover, we find that covariances calculated from small networks may be used to effectively initialize a variety of larger networks of different depths, widths, patch sizes, and kernel sizes, indicating a degree of model-independence to the covariance structure. Motivated by these findings, we then propose a learning-free multivariate initialization scheme for convolutional filters using a simple, closed-form construction of their covariance. Models using our initialization outperform those using traditional univariate initializations, and typically meet or exceed the performance of those initialized from the covariances of learned filters; in some cases, this improvement can be achieved without training the depthwise convolutional filters at all.},

We introduce two new benchmarks, TextVQA-C and GQA-C, to systematically evaluate how corruptions affect scene text understanding and object-based reasoning, respectively. Our analysis reveals that transformer-based VLMs exhibit distinct vulnerability patterns across tasks: text recognition deteriorates most severely under blur and snow corruptions, while object reasoning shows higher sensitivity to corruptions such as frost and impulse noise. We connect these observations to the frequency-domain characteristics of different corruptions, revealing how transformers' inherent bias toward low-frequency processing explains their differential robustness patterns. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing more corruption-robust vision-language models for real-world applications.},

Inspired by this advancement and primarily motivated by the emergence of tabular and structured document image applications, we investigate which self-supervised pretraining objectives, architectures, and fine-tuning strategies are most effective. To address these questions, we introduce RegCLR, a new self-supervised framework that combines contrastive and regularized methods and is compatible with the standard Vision Transformer architecture. Then, RegCLR is instantiated by integrating masked autoencoders as a representative example of a contrastive method and enhanced Barlow Twins as a representative example of a regularized method with configurable input image augmentations in both branches. Several real-world table recognition scenarios (e.g., extracting tables from document images), ranging from standard Word and Latex documents to even more challenging electronic health records (EHR) computer screen images, have been shown to benefit greatly from the representations learned from this new framework, with detection average-precision (AP) improving relatively by 4.8\% for Table, 11.8\% for Column, and 11.1\% for GUI objects over a previous fully supervised baseline on real-world EHR screen images.},

By compressing the spatial size of images, this approach can effectively shorten the token sequence and reduce the computational cost of ViT-like plain architectures. In this work, we aim to thoroughly examine the information loss caused by this patchification-based compressive encoding paradigm and how it affects visual understanding. We conduct extensive patch size scaling experiments and excitedly observe an intriguing scaling law in patchification: the models can consistently benefit from decreased patch sizes and attain improved predictive performance, until it reaches the minimum patch size of 1x1, i.e., pixel tokenization. This conclusion is broadly applicable across different vision tasks, various input scales, and diverse architectures such as ViT and the recent Mamba models. Moreover, as a by-product, we discover that with smaller patches, task-specific decoder heads become less critical for dense prediction. In the experiments, we successfully scale up the visual sequence to an exceptional length of 50,176 tokens, achieving a competitive test accuracy of 84.6\% with a base-sized model on the ImageNet-1k benchmark. We hope this study can provide insights and theoretical foundations for future works of building non-compressive vision models. Code is available at https://github.com/wangf3014/Patch\_Scaling.},

In this paper, we propose a new decoding strategy, self-consistency, to replace the naive greedy decoding used in chain-of-thought prompting. It first samples a diverse set of reasoning paths instead of only taking the greedy one, and then selects the most consistent answer by marginalizing out all possible reasoning paths. Self-consistency leverages the intuition that a complex reasoning problem typically admits multiple different ways of thinking leading to its unique correct answer. Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that self-consistency boosts the performance of chain-of-thought prompting with a striking margin on a range of popular arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K (+17.9\%), SVAMP (+11.0\%), AQuA (+12.2\%), StrategyQA (+6.4\%) and ARC-challenge (+3.9\%).},

In this work we show a systematic design for how convolutional networks can be incorporated into the pose machine framework for learning image features and image-dependent spatial models for the task of pose estimation. The contribution of this paper is to implicitly model long-range dependencies between variables in structured prediction tasks such as articulated pose estimation. We achieve this by designing a sequential architecture composed of convolutional networks that directly operate on belief maps from previous stages, producing increasingly refined estimates for part locations, without the need for explicit graphical model-style inference. Our approach addresses the characteristic difficulty of vanishing gradients during training by providing a natural learning objective function that enforces intermediate supervision, thereby replenishing back-propagated gradients and conditioning the learning procedure. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and outperform competing methods on standard benchmarks including the MPII, LSP, and FLIC datasets.},

In this paper, to combine the best of both approaches, we propose to use the CTC-Prefix-Score during S2S decoding. Hereby, during beam search, paths that are invalid according to the CTC confidence matrix are penalised. Our network architecture is composed of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as visual backbone, bidirectional Long-Short-Term-Memory-Cells (LSTMs) as encoder, and a decoder which is a Transformer with inserted mutual attention layers. The CTC confidences are computed on the encoder while the Transformer is only used for character-wise S2S decoding. We evaluate this setup on three HTR data sets: IAM, Rimes, and StAZH. On IAM, we achieve a competitive Character Error Rate (CER) of 2.95\% when pretraining our model on synthetic data and including a character-based language model for contemporary English. Compared to other state-of-the-art approaches, our model requires about 10-20 times less parameters.

Since Transformers represent a traditional Sequence-To-Sequence (S2S)-approach they can be used for several different tasks such as Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR). In this paper, we propose a bidirectional Transformer architecture for line-based HTR that is composed of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction and a Transformer-based encoder/decoder, whereby the decoding is performed in reading-order direction and reversed. A voter combines the two predicted sequences to obtain a single result. Our network performed worse compared to a traditional Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) approach on the IAM-dataset but reduced the state-of-the-art of Transformers-based approaches by about 25\% without using additional data. On a significantly larger dataset, the proposed Transformer significantly outperformed our reference model by about 26\%. In an error analysis, we show that the Transformer is able to learn a strong language model which explains why a larger training dataset is required to outperform traditional approaches and discuss why Transformers should be used with caution for HTR due to several shortcomings such as repetitions in the text.},

  abstract = {As camera-based documents are increasingly used, the rec-tification of distorted document images becomes a need to improve the recognition performance. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for both rectifying distorted document image and removing background finely, by estimating pixel-wise displacements using a fully convolutional network (FCN). The document image is rectified by transformation according to the displacements of pixels. The FCN is trained by regressing displacements of synthesized distorted documents, and to control the smoothness of displacements, we propose a Local Smooth Constraint (LSC) in regularization. Our approach is easy to implement and consumes moderate computing resource. Experiments proved that our approach can dewarp document images effectively under various geometric distortions, and has achieved the state-of-the-art performance in terms of local details and overall effect.},

  abstract = {Empowering large language models (LLMs) to accurately express confidence in their answers is essential for reliable and trustworthy decision-making. Previous confidence elicitation methods, which primarily rely on *white-box access* to internal model information or model fine-tuning, have become less suitable for LLMs, especially closed-source commercial APIs. This leads to a growing need to explore the untapped area of *black-box* approaches for LLM uncertainty estimation. To better break down the problem, we define a systematic framework with three components: *prompting* strategies for eliciting verbalized confidence, *sampling* methods for generating multiple responses, and *aggregation* techniques for computing consistency. We then benchmark these methods on two key tasks---confidence calibration and failure prediction---across five types of datasets (e.g., commonsense and arithmetic reasoning) and five widely-used LLMs including GPT-4 and LLaMA 2 Chat. Our analysis uncovers several key insights: 1) LLMs, when verbalizing their confidence, tend to be *overconfident*, potentially imitating human patterns of expressing confidence. 2) As model capability scales up, both calibration and failure prediction performance improve, yet still far from ideal performance. 3) Employing our proposed strategies, such as human-inspired prompts, consistency among multiple responses, and better aggregation strategies can help mitigate this overconfidence from various perspectives. 4) Comparisons with white-box methods indicate that while white-box methods perform better, the gap is narrow, e.g., 0.522 to 0.605 in AUROC. Despite these advancements, none of these techniques consistently outperform others, and all investigated methods struggle in challenging tasks, such as those requiring professional knowledge, indicating significant scope for improvement. We believe this study can serve as a strong baseline and provide insights for eliciting confidence in black-box LLMs. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/MiaoXiong2320/llm-uncertainty.},

This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the deep learning techniques oriented at free-hand sketch data, and the applications that they enable. The main contents of this survey include: (i) A discussion of the intrinsic traits and unique challenges of free-hand sketch, to highlight the essential differences between sketch data and other data modalities, e.g., natural photos. (ii) A review of the developments of free-hand sketch research in the deep learning era, by surveying existing datasets, research topics, and the state-of-the-art methods through a detailed taxonomy and experimental evaluation. (iii) Promotion of future work via a discussion of bottlenecks, open problems, and potential research directions for the community. Finally, to support future sketch research and applications, we contribute TorchSketch -- the first sketch-oriented open-source deep learning library, which is built on PyTorch and available at https://github.com/PengBoXiangShang/torchsketch/.},

Despite the widespread use of pre-training models for NLP applications, they almost exclusively focus on text-level manipulation, while neglecting layout and style information that is vital for document image understanding. In this paper, we propose the {\textbackslash}textbf\{LayoutLM\} to jointly model interactions between text and layout information across scanned document images, which is beneficial for a great number of real-world document image understanding tasks such as information extraction from scanned documents. Furthermore, we also leverage image features to incorporate words' visual information into LayoutLM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that text and layout are jointly learned in a single framework for document-level pre-training. It achieves new state-of-the-art results in several downstream tasks, including form understanding (from 70.72 to 79.27), receipt understanding (from 94.02 to 95.24) and document image classification (from 93.07 to 94.42).

In this paper, we analyze the latest model, GPT-4V(ision), to deepen the understanding of LMMs. The analysis focuses on the intriguing tasks that GPT-4V can perform, containing test samples to probe the quality and genericity of GPT-4V's capabilities, its supported inputs and working modes, and the effective ways to prompt the model. In our approach to exploring GPT-4V, we curate and organize a collection of carefully designed qualitative samples spanning a variety of domains and tasks. Observations from these samples demonstrate that GPT-4V's unprecedented ability in processing arbitrarily interleaved multimodal inputs and the genericity of its capabilities together make GPT-4V a powerful multimodal generalist system. Furthermore, GPT-4V's unique capability of understanding visual markers drawn on input images can give rise to new human-computer interaction methods such as visual referring prompting. We conclude the report with in-depth discussions on the emerging application scenarios and the future research directions for GPT-4V-based systems. We hope that this preliminary exploration will inspire future research on the next-generation multimodal task formulation, new ways to exploit and enhance LMMs to solve real-world problems, and gaining better understanding of multimodal foundation models. Finally, we acknowledge that the model under our study is solely the product of OpenAI's innovative work, and they should be fully credited for its development.

A multi-LLM ensemble pipeline ingested ClinicalTrials.gov records, applied a structured JSON schema, and generated comparable outputs from unstructured text. The pipeline retrieved 83 aging-related tDCS trials---roughly double the yield of a conventional keyword search. Across models, agreement was almost perfect for the binary field brain stimulation used (Fleiss {$\kappa$} {$\approx$} 0.92) and substantial for the categorical primary target ({$\kappa$} {$\approx$} 0.71). Numeric parameters such as stimulation intensity and session duration showed excellent consistency when explicitly reported (ICC 0.95--0.96); secondary targets and free-text duration phrases remained challenging ({$\kappa$} {$\approx$} 0.61; ICC {$\approx$} 0.35). An ensemble consensus (majority vote or averaging) resolved most disagreements and delivered near-perfect reliability on core stimulation attributes ({$\kappa$} = 0.94). These results demonstrate that multi-LLM ensembles can markedly expand trial coverage and reach expert-level accuracy on well-defined fields while still requiring human oversight for nuanced or sparsely reported details. The benchmark and open-source workflow set a solid baseline for future advances in prompt engineering, model specialization, and ensemble strategies aimed at fully automated evidence synthesis in neurostimulation research involving aging populations. Overall, the five-model multi-LLM ensemble doubled the number of eligible aging-related tDCS trials retrieved versus keyword searching and achieved near-perfect agreement on core stimulation parameters ({$\kappa$} {$\approx$} 0.94), demonstrating expert-level extraction accuracy.},

In this paper, we present systematic analysis of phrasal representations in state-of-the-art pre-trained transformers. We use tests leveraging human judgments of phrase similarity and meaning shift, and compare results before and after control of word overlap, to tease apart lexical effects versus composition effects. We find that phrase representation in these models relies heavily on word content, with little evidence of nuanced composition. We also identify variations in phrase representation quality across models, layers, and representation types, and make corresponding recommendations for usage of representations from these models.},

This is usually actualized through feedforward multilayer neural networks, e.g. ConvNets, where each layer forms one of such successive representations. However, an alternative that can achieve the same goal is a feedback based approach in which the representation is formed in an iterative manner based on a feedback received from previous iteration's output. We establish that a feedback based approach has several fundamental advantages over feedforward: it enables making early predictions at the query time, its output naturally conforms to a hierarchical structure in the label space (e.g. a taxonomy), and it provides a new basis for Curriculum Learning. We observe that feedback networks develop a considerably different representation compared to feedforward counterparts, in line with the aforementioned advantages. We put forth a general feedback based learning architecture with the endpoint results on par or better than existing feedforward networks with the addition of the above advantages. We also investigate several mechanisms in feedback architectures (e.g. skip connections in time) and design choices (e.g. feedback length). We hope this study offers new perspectives in quest for more natural and practical learning models.},

  abstract = {Self-supervised learning (SSL) is rapidly closing the gap with supervised methods on large computer vision benchmarks. A successful approach to SSL is to learn embeddings which are invariant to distortions of the input sample. However, a recurring issue with this approach is the existence of trivial constant solutions. Most current methods avoid such solutions by careful implementation details. We propose an objective function that naturally avoids collapse by measuring the cross-correlation matrix between the outputs of two identical networks fed with distorted versions of a sample, and making it as close to the identity matrix as possible. This causes the embedding vectors of distorted versions of a sample to be similar, while minimizing the redundancy between the components of these vectors. The method is called Barlow Twins, owing to neuroscientist H. Barlow's redundancy-reduction principle applied to a pair of identical networks. Barlow Twins does not require large batches nor asymmetry between the network twins such as a predictor network, gradient stopping, or a moving average on the weight updates. Intriguingly it benefits from very high-dimensional output vectors.

  abstract = {Visual understanding goes well beyond object recognition. With one glance at an image, we can effortlessly imagine the world beyond the pixels: for instance, we can infer people's actions, goals, and mental states. While this task is easy for humans, it is tremendously difficult for today's vision systems, requiring higher-order cognition and commonsense reasoning about the world. We formalize this task as Visual Commonsense Reasoning. Given a challenging question about an image, a machine must answer correctly and then provide a rationale justifying its answer. Next, we introduce a new dataset, VCR, consisting of 290k multiple choice QA problems derived from 110k movie scenes. The key recipe for generating non-trivial and high-quality problems at scale is Adversarial Matching, a new approach to transform rich annotations into multiple choice questions with minimal bias. Experimental results show that while humans find VCR easy (over 90\% accuracy), state-of-the-art vision models struggle ({\textasciitilde}45\%). To move towards cognition-level understanding, we present a new reasoning engine, Recognition to Cognition Networks (R2C), that models the necessary layered inferences for grounding, contextualization, and reasoning. R2C helps narrow the gap between humans and machines ({\textasciitilde}65\%); still, the challenge is far from solved, and we provide analysis that suggests avenues for future work.},

In this study, color clustering is utilized as a prior guide to group patches, enhancing their spatial relationships. Additionally, patch sizes are adaptively adjusted during training to balance speed and accuracy, while unimportant tokens and blocks in the model are pruned. We propose APViT, which modifies the ViTs model for scene text recognition requirements. It consists of three components: Sparse Patches Selection (SPS), ViT-STR, and Token Code (TC). First, SPS segments images into appropriate patches and clusters similar ones to explore diverse local patches adaptively. Second, we enhance the ViTs model specifically for scene text recognition as ViT-STR. Finally, TC prunes non-essential parts of the network based on self-attention mechanisms to accelerate performance. Consequently, our proposed APViT model outperforms state-of-the-art methods across several datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness.},

While state-of-the-art VLMs show improved average OCR accuracy, they still struggle with sample-level quality degradation and lack reliable automatic detection of low-quality outputs. We introduce Consensus Entropy (CE), a training-free post-inference method that quantifies OCR uncertainty by aggregating outputs from multiple VLMs. Our approach exploits a key insight: correct VLM OCR predictions converge in output space while errors diverge. We develop a lightweight multi-model framework that effectively identifies problematic samples, selects the best outputs and combines model strengths. Experiments across multiple OCR benchmarks and VLMs demonstrate that CE outperforms VLM-as-judge approaches and single-model baselines at the same cost and achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple metrics. For instance, our solution demonstrates: achieving 15.2\% higher F1 scores than VLM-as-judge methods in quality verification, delivering 6.0\% accuracy gains on mathematical calculation tasks, and requiring rephrasing only 7.3\% of inputs while maintaining overall performance. Notably, the entire process requires neither training nor supervision while maintaining plug-and-play functionality throughout.},

  abstract = {Digitization of scanned receipts aims to extract text from receipt images and save it into structured documents. This is usually split into two sub-tasks: text localization and optical character recognition (OCR). Most existing OCR models only focus on the cropped text instance images, which require the bounding box information provided by a text region detection model. Introducing an additional detector to identify the text instance images in advance is inefficient, however instance-level OCR models have very low accuracy when processing the whole image for the document-level OCR, such as receipt images containing multiple text lines arranged in various layouts. To this end, we propose a localization-free document-level OCR model for transcribing all the characters in a receipt image into an ordered sequence end-to-end. Specifically , we finetune the pretrained Transformer-based instance-level model TrOCR with randomly cropped image chunks, and gradually increase the image chunk size to generalize the recognition ability from instance images to full-page images. In our experiments on the SROIE receipt OCR dataset, the model finetuned with our strategy achieved 64.4 F1-score and a 22.8\% character error rates (CER) on the word-level and character-level metrics, respectively, which outperforms the baseline results with 48.5 F1-score and 50.6\% CER. The best model, which splits the full image into 15 equally sized chunks, gives 87.8 F1-score and 4.98\% CER with minimal additional pre or post-processing of the output. Moreover, the characters in the generated document-level sequences are arranged in the reading order, which is practical for real-world applications.},

  abstract = {As enthusiasm for scaling computation (data and parameters) in the pretraining era gradually diminished, test-time scaling (TTS), also referred to as ``test-time computing'' has emerged as a prominent research focus. Recent studies demonstrate that TTS can further elicit the problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling significant breakthroughs not only in specialized reasoning tasks, such as mathematics and coding, but also in general tasks like open-ended Q\&A. However, despite the explosion of recent efforts in this area, there remains an urgent need for a comprehensive survey offering a systemic understanding. To fill this gap, we propose a unified, multidimensional framework structured along four core dimensions of TTS research: what to scale, how to scale, where to scale, and how well to scale. Building upon this taxonomy, we conduct an extensive review of methods, application scenarios, and assessment aspects, and present an organized decomposition that highlights the unique functional roles of individual techniques within the broader TTS landscape. From this analysis, we distill the major developmental trajectories of TTS to date and offer hands-on guidelines for practical deployment. Furthermore, we identify several open challenges and offer insights into promising future directions, including further scaling, clarifying the functional essence of techniques, generalizing to more tasks, and more attributions.

We proposed a novel algorithm framework using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict pen tip movement for human handwriting pictures. The network is a regression CNN model, whose inputs are a series of part-drawn handwriting images and output is a vector that represents the probability of next stroke point position. The predicted output vector is utilized by an iteration framework to generate pen movement sequences. Experiments on public Chinese and English online handwriting database have indicated that the proposed model performs competitively in multi-writer handwriting PTMP and DOR tasks. Furthermore, the experiment demonstrated that characters belong to different languages shares some common writing patterns and the proposed method could learn these laws effectively.},

  abstract = {Recognizing the layout of unstructured digital documents is an important step when parsing the documents into structured machine-readable format for downstream applications. Deep neural networks that are developed for computer vision have been proven to be an effective method to analyze layout of document images. However, document layout datasets that are currently publicly available are several magnitudes smaller than established computing vision datasets. Models have to be trained by transfer learning from a base model that is pre-trained on a traditional computer vision dataset. In this paper, we develop the PubLayNet dataset for document layout analysis by automatically matching the XML representations and the content of over 1 million PDF articles that are publicly available on PubMed Central. The size of the dataset is comparable to established computer vision datasets, containing over 360 thousand document images, where typical document layout elements are annotated. The experiments demonstrate that deep neural networks trained on PubLayNet accurately recognize the layout of scientific articles. The pre-trained models are also a more effective base mode for transfer learning on a different document domain. We release the dataset (https://github.com/ibm-aur-nlp/PubLayNet) to support development and evaluation of more advanced models for document layout analysis.},

  abstract = {Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in understanding visual information with human languages. However, LVLMs still suffer from object hallucination, which is the problem of generating descriptions that include objects that do not actually exist in the images. This can negatively impact many vision-language tasks, such as visual summarization and reasoning. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet powerful algorithm, LVLM Hallucination Revisor (LURE), to post-hoc rectify object hallucination in LVLMs by reconstructing less hallucinatory descriptions. LURE is grounded in a rigorous statistical analysis of the key factors underlying object hallucination, including co-occurrence (the frequent appearance of certain objects alongside others in images), uncertainty (objects with higher uncertainty during LVLM decoding), and object position (hallucination often appears in the later part of the generated text). LURE can also be seamlessly integrated with any LVLMs. We evaluate LURE on six open-source LVLMs, achieving a 23\% improvement in general object hallucination evaluation metrics over the previous best approach. In both GPT and human evaluations, LURE consistently ranks at the top. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/YiyangZhou/LURE.},

  abstract = {The success of deep learning has brought forth a wave of interest in computer hardware design to better meet the high demands of neural network inference. In particular, analog computing hardware has been heavily motivated specifically for accelerating neural networks, based on either electronic, optical or photonic devices, which may well achieve lower power consumption than conventional digital electronics. However, these proposed analog accelerators suffer from the intrinsic noise generated by their physical components, which makes it challenging to achieve high accuracy on deep neural networks. Hence, for successful deployment on analog accelerators, it is essential to be able to train deep neural networks to be robust to random continuous noise in the network weights, which is a somewhat new challenge in machine learning. In this paper, we advance the understanding of noisy neural networks. We outline how a noisy neural network has reduced learning capacity as a result of loss of mutual information between its input and output. To combat this, we propose using knowledge distillation combined with noise injection during training to achieve more noise robust networks, which is demonstrated experimentally across different networks and datasets, including ImageNet. Our method achieves models with as much as two times greater noise tolerance compared with the previous best attempts, which is a significant step towards making analog hardware practical for deep learning.},

We summarize the main models for each degradation problem as well as recent work, such as the binarization model that can be used to deal with the degradation of background textures, lettering smudges. When facing the problem of fading, a model for stroke connectivity can be used, while the other three degradation problems are mostly deep learning models. We discuss the current limitations and challenges of each degradation task and introduce the common public datasets and metrics. We identify several promising research directions and opportunities for future research.},

We present an approach for learning to translate an image from a source domain \$X\$ to a target domain \$Y\$ in the absence of paired examples. Our goal is to learn a mapping \$G: X {\textbackslash}rightarrow Y\$ such that the distribution of images from \$G(X)\$ is indistinguishable from the distribution \$Y\$ using an adversarial loss. Because this mapping is highly under-constrained, we couple it with an inverse mapping \$F: Y {\textbackslash}rightarrow X\$ and introduce a cycle consistency loss to push \$F(G(X)) {\textbackslash}approx X\$ (and vice versa). Qualitative results are presented on several tasks where paired training data does not exist, including collection style transfer, object transfiguration, season transfer, photo enhancement, etc. Quantitative comparisons against several prior methods demonstrate the superiority of our approach.},
